it's secondhand
it's so exciting
it's so hopeless
it's so pathetic
it's so peaceful
it's still early
it's still there
it's supper time
it's the big one
it's their fault
it's their right
it's time to eat
it's too painful
it's unnecessary
it's very boring
it's very bright
it's very common
it's very direct
it's very simple
it's worth a try
its color is red
just a moment
just be yourself
just follow them

is it that simple
is one of you tom
is sugar a poison
is that tom's hat
is that tom's son
is that a new tie
is that a problem
is that a promise
is that a red pen
is that chocolate
is that dog tom's
is that important

isn't it possible
isn't that pretty
it ain't over yet
it all went wrong
it became useless
it belongs to tom
it broke my heart
it cannot be true
it clearly worked
it costs too much
it could be risky
it depends on you
it didn't go well
it doesn't matter
it fell to pieces
it had to be done
it happened today
it has to be true
it hurt me deeply
it is a good cake
it is a small dog
it is not my name
it is not raining
it is our destiny
it is pretty cold
it is secondhand
it is snowing now
it is very simple
it isn't a threat
it isn't about us
it isn't bad here
it isn't official
it isn't over yet
it isn't personal
it isn't possible
it isn't that far
it isn't too cold
it isn't too deep
it isn't too hard
it isn't up to me
it isn't up to us
it just scares me
it looks familiar
it looks like tom
it made me strong
it might be risky
it might not work
it must be simple
it never happened
it rained heavily
it seemed strange
it seemed to work
it should be fine
it sure is pretty
it sure scared me
it takes patience
it was tom's turn
it was tom's wish
it was a bad idea
it was a busy day
it was a cold day
it was a disgrace
it was a pleasure
it was a surprise
it was a warm day
it was attractive
it was convenient
it was convincing
it was dark green
it was depressing
it was disturbing
it was impressive
it was incredible
it was inevitable
it was my destiny
it was no problem
it was really fun
it was so chaotic
it was their idea
it was very funny
it was very scary
it wasn't a party
it wasn't planned
it will be cloudy
it won't be ready
it won't help you
it won't work out
it worked for tom
it'll be exciting
it'll be painless
it'll confuse him
it'll happen soon
it'll take months
it's monday night
it's monday today
it's october 20th
it's a cloudy day
it's a compliment
it's a dictionary
it's a girl thing
it's a good dream
it's a great deal
it's a long story
it's a lot of fun
it's a lot to ask
it's a nice party
it's a risky plan
it's a short walk
it's a small town
it's all i can do
it's all in there
it's all my fault
it's almost ready
it's already late
it's already open
it's an old piano
it's been decided
it's been snowing
it's blowing hard
it's cloudy today
it's cold in here
it's cold outside
it's easy for tom
it's easy for you
it's embarrassing
it's finally here
it's for tourists
it's getting late
it's gotten worse
it's great to win
it's hard to tell
it's human nature
it's ideal for us
it's in my pocket
it's just a dream
it's just a novel
it's just a phone
it's just a rumor
it's like a dream
it's my brother's
it's my call tom
it's my lucky day
it's my only hope
it's not a secret
it's not about us
it's not an issue
it's not bad here
it's not for sale
it's not my fault
it's not my style
it's not over yet
it's not possible
it's not so cheap
it's not that bad
it's not that far
it's not the same
it's not too late
it's not too much
it's not up to me
it's not up to us
it's not worth it
it's now or never
it's on the table
it's only a dream
it's our pleasure
it's pretty funny
it's pretty light
it's pretty weird
it's probably tom
it's questionable
it's quite simple
it's quite strong
it's raining here
it's really early
it's really great
it's really there
it's really weird
it's snowing here
it's so beautiful
it's still monday
it's such a waste
it's the same hat
it's the same one
it's their choice
it's time for bed
it's time to quit
it's time to rest
it's time to stop
it's time to talk
it's too far away
it's too late now
it's too unstable
it's unbelievable
it's very fragile
it's very popular
it's very private
it's very serious
it's worth a shot
just keep walking
just listen to me
just take me home
keep away from me
keep following me
keep this in mind
keep your head up
leave immediately
leave it up to us
leave me in peace

it rained for days
it rained that day
it really happened
it saved our lives
it seemed too easy
it seemed very odd
it should be there
it smells like tom
it snowed for days
it sounds familiar
it sounds like fun
it started to snow
it turned out well
it was tom's fault
it was a bad movie
it was a challenge
it was a fun night
it was a good plan
it was a nightmare
it was a sunny day
it was a tradition
it was all a dream
it was all a trick
it was all so easy
it was an accident
it was done before
it was fascinating
it was frustrating
it was given to me
it was good enough
it was hot outside
it was interesting
it was just a joke
it was magnificent
it was my decision
it was my suitcase
it was nearly noon
it was only a joke
it was predictable
it was pretty easy
it was quite funny
it was quite windy
it was really dark
it was really easy
it was really good
it was really hard
it was really ugly
it was six o'clock
it was so much fun
it was so romantic
it was still there
it was too intense
it was very simple
it was your choice
it wasn't a threat
it wasn't my fault
it wasn't that big
it wasn't upstairs
it won't be so bad
it won't cost much
it won't take long
it worked at first
it works perfectly
it wouldn't matter
it'd be a disaster
it'll be all right
it'll be different
it'll be difficult
it'll be hard work
it'll be wonderful
it'll happen again
it'll never happen
it'll rain tonight
it's tom's profile
it's a french word
it's a bad disease
it's a bad example
it's a common vice
it's a cruel world
it's a funny story
it's a good school
it's a good system
it's a great start
it's a happy thing
it's a huge gamble
it's a huge secret
it's a kind of cat
it's a nice change
it's a perfect day
it's a small world
it's a vague story
it's about to rain
it's all our fault
it's almost summer
it's already seven
it's been horrible
it's been terrible
it's begun to rain
it's bound to rain
it's disappointing
it's easy for them
it's for my family
it's fun to travel
it's getting there
it's going to burn
it's going to heal
it's going to rain
it's going to work
it's in good hands
it's in the fridge
it's just a theory
it's just annoying
it's just business
it's just midnight
it's just not fair
it's kind of funny
it's kind of scary
it's me again tom
it's my last offer
it's not christmas
it's not a disease

it's not a mistake
it's not a problem
it's not important
it's not practical
it's not so little
it's not so simple
it's not that easy
it's not that hard
it's not there now
it's not very easy
it's not very good
it's not very nice
it's our only hope
it's pretty simple
it's probably hard
it's probably true
it's quitting time
it's raining again
it's raining there
it's rather ironic
it's really bright
it's really pretty
it's rude to stare
it's sad but true
it's something new
it's still immoral
it's still raining
it's still snowing
it's the wrong one
it's their problem
it's three o'clock
it's time to begin
it's time to leave
it's time to party
it's time to sleep
it's time to start
it's too difficult
it's too expensive
it's totally wrong
it's under the bed
it's very cold now
it's very detailed
it's very hot here

is it far from here
is it getting worse
is it going to rain

isn't it incredible
isn't she beautiful
isn't that adorable
isn't that childish
isn't that exciting
isn't that possible
isn't this exciting
isn't this fun tom
it already happened
it can be dangerous
it can be difficult
it can't be changed
it cannot last long
it didn't cost much
it didn't last long
it doesn't annoy me
it finally happened
it happened so fast
it has been decided
it is freezing cold
it is going to snow
it is nothing to me
it is only too true
it is snowing today
it is too expensive
it isn't a bit cold
it isn't a hospital
it isn't believable
it isn't cold today
it isn't impossible
it isn't irrelevant
it isn't just a pen
it isn't real money
it isn't spring yet
it isn't surprising
it isn't the answer
it isn't very spicy
it isn't worth much
it isn't you i hate
it just disappeared
it looked like rain
it looks like a ufo
it looks like a bar
it made me feel bad
it makes me furious
it makes me jealous
it may be dangerous
it may snow tonight
it might rain today
it must've been tom
it must've been fun
it needs to be done
it often rains here
it often snows here
it rained all night
it rained last week
it rained yesterday
it seemed so simple
it seems good to me
it seems impossible
it seems reasonable
it seems so strange
it shouldn't matter
it smells delicious
it smells wonderful
it snowed in boston
it snowed yesterday
it sounds dangerous
it sounds very good
it still isn't over
it sure wasn't easy
it tastes very good
it took three years
it was a bad choice
it was a cold night
it was a fair price
it was a good start
it was a great trip
it was a hot debate
it was a long night
it was a lot of fun
it was a nice party
it was a nice story
it was a stupid bet
it was a tough test
it was all my fault
it was embarrassing
it was fairly funny
it was getting dark
it was hard for tom
it was just awkward
it was like a dream
it was like torture
it was pretty funny
it was pretty smart
it was probably tom
it was quite simple
it was really cheap
it was really sweet
it was seven thirty
it was so different
it was so difficult
it was such a shock
it was very painful
it was very similar
it was very special
it was very strange
it was worth trying
it wasn't a mistake
it wasn't a request
it wasn't easy work
it wasn't expensive
it wasn't important
it wasn't necessary
it wasn't real love
it wasn't that loud
it won't make sense
it worked perfectly
it works every time
it'll be a good day
it'll be a nice day
it'll be no problem
it'll be our secret
it'll be ready soon
it'll rain for sure
it'll rain tomorrow
it'll snow tomorrow
it'll work for sure
it's saturday today
it's tom's birthday
it's tom's decision
it's tom's favorite
it's a big decision
it's a crazy market
it's a diamond ring
it's a fact of life
it's a free country
it's a free service
it's a good concept
it's a good program
it's a group effort
it's a hard problem
it's a huge mistake
it's a long journey
it's a long process
it's a mess in here
it's a nice feeling
it's a perfect trap
it's a pretty house
it's a rare disease
it's a real bargain
it's a safety issue
it's a slow process
it's a world record
it's about this big
it's actually funny
it's all new for me
it's all your fault
it's almost october
it's almost perfect
it's already eleven
it's an indian dish
it's an inside joke
it's an older model
it's as cold as ice
it's been delivered
it's been destroyed
it's been different
it's been fantastic
it's been great fun
it's been very hard
it's been wonderful
it's being repaired
it's cold in boston
it's dangerous here
it's definitely tom
it's extremely rare
it's extremely ugly
it's finally friday
it's free of charge
it's getting cloudy
it's getting darker
it's going to be ok
it's going to break
it's good isn't it
it's hard to accept
it's hard to let go
it's hard to resist
it's hard to say no
it's hard you know
it's in plain sight
it's in the kitchen
it's just too risky
it's kind of creepy
it's likely to rain
it's my turn to pay
it's neat and clean
it's never too late
it's nobody's fault
it's not a bad idea
it's not a big deal
it's not attractive
it's not believable
it's not big enough
it's not contagious

i've seen everything
i've spoken with tom
i've suffered enough
i've won first prize
i've won the lottery
i've won three times
i've worked with tom
ignore tom's request
ignore what tom said
incredible isn't it
is boston a big city
is mary tom's mother
is tom about to sing
is tom available now
is tom going to jail
is tom going to live
is tom in his office
is tom looking at me
is tom really guilty
is tom seeing anyone
is tom still at home
is tom still in town
is tom still working
is tom working today
is he reading a book
is it ok if we begin
is it a cat or a dog
is it better to sell
is it fun to do that
is it open on sunday
is it right or wrong
is it still worth it
is she a taxi driver
is she making a doll
is that a confession
is that a fire truck
is that a good place
is that a good thing
is that all tom does
is that all it takes
is that all you want
is that answer right
is that funny to you
is that how it works
is that pencil yours
is that possible now
is that satisfactory
is that so difficult
is that the same guy
is that why you came
is that your package
is the gas turned on
is the lemonade good
is the zoo near here
is this a compliment
is this beef or pork
is this diamond real
is this good english
is this how it works
is this pencil tom's
is this pencil yours
is this place secure
is this your bicycle
is this your husband
is this your opinion
is tomorrow saturday
is your trunk locked
isn't tom courageous
isn't tom incredible
isn't it interesting
isn't life wonderful
isn't that tom's hat
isn't that beautiful
isn't that fantastic
it all worked out ok
it belongs to me now
it could be anywhere
it definitely helped
it didn't seem right
it doesn't bother me
it doesn't bother us
it doesn't seem fair
it gets on my nerves
it happened too fast
it has my name on it
it has to be removed
it is already eleven
it is in the kitchen
it is kind of pretty
it is likely to rain
it is not cold today
it is not impossible
it is of great value
it is time to get up
it is very hot today
it is wrong to steal
it isn't complicated
it isn't easy for me
it isn't hard for me
it isn't interesting
it isn't their fault
it isn't true is it
it isn't yet working
it isn't your choice
it just doesn't work
it looks fascinating
it looks like an egg
it made people smile
it makes me feel sad
it makes me so happy
it makes us stronger
it makes you curious
it may cost me votes
it meant a lot to me
it might be too late
it must be destroyed
it must've been love
it needed to be said
it needs to be fixed
it rained for a week
it rarely snows here
it seemed to go well
it seems pretty easy
it seems right to me
it should be allowed
it should be illegal
it snowed last night
it sure is difficult
it tastes just right
it tastes like sugar
it was a clear night
it was a good answer
it was a good choice
it was a great night
it was a huge change
it was a huge relief
it was a long flight
it was a long letter
it was a perfect day
it was a scary place
it was a team effort
it was all a big lie
it was an experiment
it was extraordinary
it was her first job
it was his first job
it was hot yesterday
it was just fabulous
it was kind of scary
it was lots of money
it was my first kiss
it was rather boring
it was selfish of me
it was so depressing
it was something new
it was time to leave
it was unpredictable
it was very romantic
it wasn't about that
it wasn't easy to do
it wasn't on purpose
it wasn't productive
it wasn't that funny
it wasn't their idea
it will be dark soon
it will be very hard
it will rain tonight
it will soon be dark
it won't be long now
it won't be pleasant
it won't be possible
it won't be that bad
it worked every time
it would've been fun
it'll be a long wait
it'll cost me my job
it'll soon be spring
it'll work next time
it's october already
it's tom's isn't it
it's a beautiful day
it's a beautiful job
it's a difficult job
it's a family secret
it's a fulltime job
it's a good question
it's a hard question
it's a kitchen knife
it's a lot safer now
it's a minor problem
it's a piece of cake
it's a waste of time
it's about two miles
it's all tom's fault
it's all about money
it's all over for us
it's all ready to go
it's all very simple
it's almost midnight
it's almost the same
it's already october
it's already stopped
it's an easy victory
it's an open meeting
it's an unusual name
it's as clear as mud
it's as easy as that
it's been a busy day
it's been a long war
it's been a pleasure
it's been a struggle
it's been fun for us
it's been fun so far
it's bigger than tom
it's bigger than you
it's boring to watch
it's common courtesy
it's easier this way
it's easy to do that
it's finally my turn
it's fun to watch tv
it's funny you know
it's going to happen
it's good to be here
it's good to see you
it's happening again
it's hard to believe
it's hard to justify
it's hardly a secret
it's helped us a lot
it's in the basement
it's just a headache
it's kind of awkward
it's made of leather
it's my cd isn't it
it's nice to be here
it's not tom's fault
it's not a bad thing
it's not a big thing
it's not a good idea
it's not an easy job
it's not complicated
it's not deep enough
it's not easy for me
it's not evening yet
it's not hard for me
it's not my birthday
it's not my business
it's not my decision
it's not on the menu
it's not really food
it's not so terrible
it's not that simple
it's not their fault
it's not time to die
it's not your choice
it's nothing serious
it's nothing special
it's our only option
it's over between us
it's over now right
it's perfectly legal
it's perfectly white
it's pork or nothing
it's probably a sign
it's probably not ok
it's really annoying
it's really horrible
it's really personal
it's scary down here
it's snowing heavily
it's snowing outside
it's so embarrassing
it's solid as a rock
it's sort of strange
it's started already
it's started raining
it's still a mystery
it's still not ready
it's still not right
it's still too early
it's stopped raining
it's stopped snowing
it's the ideal place
it's time for dinner
it's time to go home
it's time to grow up
it's time to move on
it's time to wake up
it's too cold for me
it's too far to walk
it's too hard for me
it's too late anyway
it's too late for me
it's too much to ask
it's totally useless
it's under the chair
it's under the table
it's very convenient
it's very warm today
it's what tom wanted
it's what we deserve
it's worth a fortune
it's worth the money
it's worth the price
join the competition
just be careful tom
just close your eyes
just go to your room
just leave tom alone
just name your price
keep the door closed
keep the door locked
keep up your courage
keep your mouth shut
keep your voice down
leave the lights off
lend me your bicycle
let me be your alibi
let me call you back
let me get my violin
let me try something
let me work in peace
let's be friends ok
let's buy this radio
let's check it later
let's discuss it now
let's do tom a favor
let's finish the job
let's go and ask tom
let's go back to tom
let's go by taxi ok
let's go for a drink
let's go get a drink
let's go have a beer
let's go on a picnic
let's go see tom now
let's go to my place
let's go to the mall
let's go wake tom up
let's have a contest
let's head back home
let's hope she comes
let's just go to bed
let's leave the room
let's let tom decide
let's make a snowman
let's meet in boston
let's meet on sunday
let's move the table
let's not be enemies
let's not bother tom
let's not exaggerate
let's play something
let's relax a little
let's sing and dance
let's split the bill
let's start with tom
let's start with you

meeting boys is hard
men are all the same

that apple isn't red
that belonged to tom
that book isn't mine
that boy doesn't eat
that can't be denied
that child got bored
that has changed now
that hasn't happened
that helped me a lot
that helps all of us
that house is famous
that is a blue house
that isn't mandatory
that isn't practical
that isn't the issue
that isn't the point
that knife cuts well
that looks expensive
that makes it easier
that medicine worked
that one's all yours
that place is creepy
that should be clear
that sounds exciting
that sounds horrible
that sounds like fun
that sounds sensible
that tastes terrible
that was tom's fault
that was a good year
that was frustrating
that was interesting
that was predictable
that was pretty easy
that was pretty good
that was pretty hard
that was really hard
that was unfortunate
that was unnecessary
that wasn't the case
that wasn't your job
that will not change
that will take hours
that woman is strong
that worked out fine
that would be creepy
that would be unfair
that would take time
that wouldn't happen
that'll be difficult

that's all i can ask
that's all i do here
that's all tom needs
that's all tom wants
that's all for today
that's all we can do
that's an order tom
that's disappointing
that's exactly right
that's extraordinary
that's fairly simple
that's her boyfriend
that's his specialty
that's his weak spot
that's how we did it
that's just not true
that's kind of vague
that's my dictionary
that's never changed
that's not a problem
that's not difficult
that's not happening
that's not important
that's not mandatory
that's not necessary
that's not practical
that's not the point
that's not the truth
that's our best hope
that's pretty normal
that's probably wise
that's quite helpful
that's quite obvious
that's really stupid
that's reason enough
that's so depressing
that's so ridiculous
that's sort of sweet
that's the challenge
that's too expensive
that's totally false
that's very generous
that's very personal
that's very possible
that's very touching
that's very unlikely
that's what tom does
that's what tom said
that's your business

i've had a lot of fun
i've had a tough year
i've heard everything
i've just been mugged
i've just gotten home
i've lost my appetite
i've made a complaint
i've made a discovery
i've made my mistakes
i've missed tom a lot
i've missed you a lot

i've started bleeding
i've tried everything
if not now then when
if you wish i'll ask
in any case we'll go
is mary a pretty girl
is mary your daughter
is tom already asleep
is tom an electrician
is tom being punished
is tom going with you
is tom ready for that
is tom ready for this
is tom very mad at me
is tom waiting for me
is tom your boyfriend
is anything happening
is everyone all right
is everything ok here
is it ok if i come in
is it ok if i hug you
is it ok to park here
is it ok to trust tom
is it tuesday already
is it a boy or a girl
is it all right to go
is it near your house
is it really all over
is it really possible
is it really worth it
is it that irrelevant
is it too complicated
is it too far to walk
is it worth something
is somebody out there
is that tom's bedroom
is that a common name
is that a possibility
is that a yes or a no
is that car too small
is that so hard to do
is that something new
is that today's paper
is that too expensive
is that what tom said
is that what tom says
is that what you feel
is that what you want
is that your own idea
is this a coincidence
is this a gift for me
is this a local train
is this clock working
is this list reliable
is this what you want
is this your umbrella
is tomorrow a holiday
is your baby sleeping
is your daughter here
is your headache gone
is your home far away
is your job dangerous
isn't tom from boston
isn't that tom's wife
isn't that a surprise
isn't that incredible
isn't the answer easy
it could be a problem
it could be dangerous
it could be expensive
it could happen again
it could still happen
it depends how i feel
it depends on my mood
it didn't make me sad
it doesn't make sense
it doesn't matter now
it doesn't sound true
it doesn't take a lot
it happened in boston
it happens frequently
it has been confirmed
it has been wonderful
it is sunday tomorrow
it is beyond my power
it is raining heavily
it is still too early
it is too late for me
it is too warm for me
it is true in a sense
it is under the chair
it is very cold today
it isn't funny at all
it isn't hard to find
it isn't much further
it isn't so hot today
it isn't true anymore
it just doesn't count
it made me very happy
it made my mother cry
it makes it difficult
it makes us feel safe
it may not be a dream
it may save your life
it meant a lot to tom
it might be dangerous
it might prove useful
it might surprise you
it only happened once
it rained all weekend
it rained last monday
it reminded me of you
it scared me to death
it seemed appropriate
it seemed interesting
it seems like a dream
it seems warm outside
it should be possible
it smells like a trap
it sounds like french
it still doesn't work
it sure is convenient
it tastes really good
it took a lot of time
it was saturday night
it was a big surprise
it was a church event
it was a funny moment
it was a good example
it was a group effort
it was a huge project
it was a long journey
it was a magic moment
it was a sight to see
it was a terrible day
it was a very hot day
it was an awful sight
it was cold yesterday
it was expensive too
it was extremely high
it was fun to be here
it was hot last night
it was just a feeling
it was just like that
it was my only choice
it was no coincidence
it was no one's fault
it was rainy that day
it was rather strange
it was three days ago
it was time for lunch
it was totally secret
it was understandable
it was very difficult
it was you wasn't it
it wasn't tom's fault
it wasn't tom was it
it wasn't a long list
it wasn't an accident
it wasn't easy for me
it wasn't interesting
it will be ready soon
it will clear up soon
it will probably rain
it will rain tomorrow
it will snow tomorrow
it won't be a problem
it won't be that easy
it won't come to that
it won't happen to me
it won't seem so long
it works like a dream
it would matter to me
it'll be a long night
it'll be hot tomorrow
it'll definitely rain
it'll only get better
it'll ruin everything
it'll soon be october
it's monday you know
it's tom on the phone
it's tom's first time
it's a common mistake
it's a fine day today
it's a matter of time
it's a necessary evil
it's a nice day today
it's a quarter to two
it's a real challenge
it's a simple mistake
it's a social problem
it's a surprise to me
it's a terrible thing
it's a very big apple
it's a very good plan
it's a very sad story
it's a very tough job
it's a waste of money
it's absolutely false
it's absolutely wrong
it's all been a waste
it's all for the best
it's all quite simple
it's almost christmas
it's been a good week
it's been a good year
it's been a long week
it's been a nice trip
it's bigger than that
it's causing problems
it's cold around here
it's driving me crazy
it's easy to get lost
it's easy to hear you
it's finally finished
it's from your family
it's going to be fine
it's going to be hard
it's going to blow up
it's hard to describe
it's hot in this room
it's incredibly white
it's just a bad dream
it's like a bad dream
it's likely a mistake
it's midnight already
it's more than enough
it's my birthday soon
it's my favorite food
it's my favorite song
it's my job you know
it's nice to meet you
it's not a fair fight
it's not a sharp pain
it's not an easy task
it's not hard to find
it's not so hot today
it's not that strange
it's not the olympics
it's not true anymore
it's not yet finished
it's nothing personal
it's obviously broken
it's obviously ruined
it's our duty to help
it's perfectly normal
it's probably a virus
it's probably haunted
it's quite warm today
it's really beautiful
it's really cool here
it's really happening
it's really hot there
it's really stressful
it's relatively early
it's sort of personal
it's starting to rain
it's starting to work
it's still a bad idea
it's still very early
it's the perfect size
it's time for a break
it's time for bed now
it's time to be going
it's time to have fun
it's too early to say
it's too late for tom
it's too spicy for me
it's totally my fault
it's very complicated
it's very frustrating
it's very interesting
it's very nice of you
it's what i'm used to
it's what you deserve
it's your only chance
it's your special day
it's your turn to pay
just a moment please
just do what tom says
just use mine for now
keep tom away from us
keep in touch with me
keep next sunday free
keep the toilet clean
keep the windows open
keep your eyes peeled
keep your hands clean
keep your shoes clean
kids do stupid things

isn't tom your brother
isn't that the problem
isn't this place great
it all makes sense now
it already costs a lot
it can be embarrassing
it could rain tomorrow
it could snow tomorrow
it could've been worse
it didn't go very well
it doesn't always work
it doesn't hurt at all
it doesn't look so bad
it doesn't seem so bad
it doesn't surprise me
it has happened before
it has started raining
it has stopped raining
it has stopped working
it has to be a mistake
it is a kind of orange
it is a moral question
it is all right so far
it is difficult for me
it is important for me
it is me that is wrong
it is not funny at all
it is not his business
it is really wonderful
it is starting to rain
it is to his advantage
it is too late for him
it is very kind of you
it isn't christmas yet
it isn't tom's problem
it isn't going to work
it isn't much of a car
it isn't so cold today
it isn't too expensive
it isn't without risks
it just doesn't matter
it just makes no sense
it looks good on paper
it looks like an apple
it makes me very happy
it makes them stronger
it makes you feel good
it might not even work
it might snow tomorrow
it must've been stolen
it needs new batteries
it needs to be removed
it never happens to me
it rains a lot in june
it really is difficult
it seems logical to me
it seems obvious to me
it seems she hates you
it seems simple enough
it seems to be serious
it should be like this
it smelled really good
it sounds like a dream
it tastes like chicken
it took me by surprise
it took me three years
it was a beautiful day
it was a chaotic scene
it was a fantastic day
it was a good decision
it was a job done well
it was a judgment call
it was a long time ago
it was a moral victory
it was a simple matter
it was a strange sight
it was a stressful day
it was a valid concern
it was a very big room
it was a violent crime
it was a waste of time
it was all an accident
it was as hard as rock
it was extremely funny
it was extremely noisy
it was extremely scary
it was hard to believe
it was important to me
it was in the basement
it was just a disaster
it was just an example
it was kind of strange
it was nearly midnight
it was not an accident
it was probably stolen
it was quite fantastic
it was really annoying
it was really slippery
it was there yesterday
it was three years ago
it was very disturbing
it was very mysterious
it was very unpleasant
it wasn't so difficult
it wasn't that serious
it will be spring soon
it won't stop bleeding
it'll all become clear
it'll be different now
it'll be fine tomorrow
it'll be too late then
it'll certainly be fun
it'll take a long time
it's ok to have doubts
it's october the third
it's tom's handwriting
it's a beautiful story
it's a book on animals
it's a common courtesy
it's a dangerous world
it's a difficult world
it's a dream come true
it's a fantastic story
it's a hard dirty job
it's a matter of pride
it's a matter of taste
it's a moral gray area
it's a personal matter
it's a present for you
it's a simple question
it's a very good thing
it's a very small town
it's a wellknown fact
it's against the rules
it's almost impossible
it's almost time to go
it's already 7 o'clock
it's already been done
it's already happening
it's an abuse of power
it's an ambitious plan
it's an excellent plan
it's awfully expensive
it's bad for the heart
it's been a crazy week
it's been a long night
it's been a rough week
it's been a tough week
it's been fun to watch
it's business as usual
it's clear to everyone
it's cold this morning
it's completely normal
it's desperate i know
it's fairly warm today
it's for you to decide
it's getting very late
it's going to be close
it's going to be risky
it's going to be scary
it's going to be sunny
it's going to get cold
it's got to be perfect
it's happening tonight
it's hard to be honest
it's hard to blame tom
it's impossible for me
it's impossible to fix
it's just an empty box
it's just as i thought
it's just common sense
it's just not worth it
it's just the opposite
it's located in boston
it's making me nervous
it's much warmer today
it's my birthday today
it's nearly impossible
it's nobody's business
it's not christmas yet
it's not a coincidence
it's not a competition
it's not a money issue
it's not a real choice
it's not far from here
it's not just a theory
it's not my first time
it's not so cold today
it's not up for debate
it's not without risks
it's nothing like that
it's now fairly common
it's now time to leave
it's now time to relax
it's obvious isn't it
it's one of my hobbies
it's one of those days
it's pretty incredible
it's probably my fault
it's quite comfortable
it's quite spectacular
it's raining here too
it's raining very hard
it's rather cold today
it's rather impressive
it's really cold today
it's really surprising
it's relatively simple
it's so hard to choose
it's so hard to decide
it's still not working
it's strange isn't it
it's ten o'clock sharp
it's the best i can do
it's their anniversary
it's their only chance
it's time to come home
it's time to eat lunch
it's time to get going
it's time to get ready
it's time to go to bed
it's too late for that
it's totally different
it's truly frightening
it's up to us to do it
it's very embarrassing
it's very hard to tell
it's what i want to do
it's what tom believed
it's worse than before
it's worth every penny
it's written in french
it's your duty to vote
john went to the store
keep it secret please
keep this money for me
keep your hands off me
learning french is fun
leave me alone please
leave the matter to me
let me go to the store
let the holidays begin

let's be friends again
let's begin on page 30
let's cross the street
let's do something fun
let's do something new

let's do this together

let's get back to work
let's get in the truck
let's get to the point
let's go to the movies
let's go to the picnic
let's have a good time
let's help tom do that
let's hope it's enough
let's hope that's true
let's just go find tom
let's just go to sleep
let's leave it at that
let's make that happen
let's meet for a drink
let's not visit boston
let's put it to a vote
let's see what it does
let's sit on the bench
let's take tom with us
let's take a rest here
let's take a short cut
let's take a tea break
let's take small steps
let's walk to the lake
let's walk toward town
life became unbearable
life is like a journey
life is so complicated
life isn't always fair
life isn't fair is it
life needs to be lived

that isn't what i said
that joke wasn't funny
that looks kind of fun
that may happen monday
that means a lot to me
that might not be easy
that movie is exciting
that movie was amusing
that must be a mistake
that must never happen
that one's my favorite
that person is like me
that remains a mystery
that reminds me of tom
that rumor soon spread
that seemed to go well
that seems crazy to me
that simply isn't true
that sounds depressing
that sounds good to me
that sounds intriguing
that sounds outrageous
that sounds reasonable
that sounds reassuring
that sounds very risky
that was a big mistake
that was a funny movie
that was a great party
that was a huge relief
that was inappropriate
that was my motivation
that was really stupid
that was the advantage
that was the easy part
that wasn't the reason
that wasn't your fault
that will be a problem
that will happen later
that won't ever happen
that won't work for me
that would be horrible
that would be possible
that would be so funny
that would be terrible
that would be very sad
that would've been fun

that's cheap isn't it
that's hard to believe
that's hard to imagine

that's hard to swallow
that's how he likes it
that's important to me
that's just my opinion
that's likely not true
that's my final answer
that's not tom's fault
that's not a bad story
that's not a bad thing
that's not a good idea
that's not interesting
that's not my umbrella
that's not soon enough
that's not the problem

that's one possibility
that's only part of it
that's part of our job
that's part of the fun
that's perfectly legal
that's pretty annoying
that's really annoying
that's really pathetic
that's right isn't it
that's so embarrassing
that's still happening
that's the one i liked
that's the part i like
that's the real reason
that's very easy to do

i'm unsure how to react
i'm used to being tired
i'm waiting for a train
i'm willing to help him
i'm willing to help you
i've always trusted tom
i've been alone so long
i've been asked to help
i've been away too long
i've been here all week
i've been married twice
i've been writing a lot
i've decided to give up
i've done a lot already
i've done no such thing
i've done stupid things
i've forgotten her name
i've found an apartment
i've gained three kilos
i've got a problem here
i've got a wife at home
i've got new priorities
i've got plenty of food
i've got plenty of room
i've got to finish this
i've got to go meet tom
i've got to keep moving
i've got to report this
i've got to see someone
i've got to talk to tom
i've got too much to do
i've had a horrible day
i've had coffee already
i've invited my friends
i've just spoken to tom
i've lost my motivation
i've made a big mistake
i've made some progress
i've never kept a diary
i've never seen the sea
i've never seen you cry
i've never slept better
i've never won anything
i've quit drinking beer
i've seen tom in action
i've sent you a package
i've sent you something
i've solved the mystery
i've taken care of that
i've told you about tom
i've told you all i can
i too have a question
if you want to cry cry
is french hard to learn
is mary your girlfriend
is tom a french teacher
is tom aboard that ship
is tom always like that
is tom behaving himself
is tom faster than mary
is tom happy about this
is tom paying attention
is tom richer than mary
is tom smarter than you
is tom still interested
is tom taller than mary
is anyone here a doctor
is change always better
is eating raw eggs safe
is everyone still alive
is everything ready now
is he a friend of yours
is he free this evening
is it ok if i park here
is it ok if i stay here
is it about ten o'clock
is it all right if i go
is it easy to get there
is it going to be scary
is it raining right now
is it safe to enter now
is it worse than before
is my explanation clear
is smoking allowed here
is that a bottle opener
is that a boy or a girl
is that a picture of me
is that against the law
is that black bag yours
is that difficult to do
is that really possible
is that still happening
is that too much to ask
is that what tom wanted
is that why you're here
is that your impression
is the fish still alive
is this camera for sale
is this happening today
is this really possible
is this the one you saw
is this what tom wanted
is this what you wanted
is this where tom lives
is this where tom works
is this your dictionary
is time travel possible
is what i'm doing wrong
is your father a doctor
is your father here yet
is your husband at home
is your name really tom
isn't tom in boston now
isn't that how it works
it all happened so fast
it appears to be broken
it belongs to my father
it belongs to my mother
it can be done in a day
it can't be that simple
it could be big trouble
it could be coincidence
it doesn't belong to me
it doesn't happen often
it doesn't look too bad
it doesn't seem so good
it doesn't seem to work
it doesn't work anymore
it gets worse every day
it happens all the time
it happens to all of us
it has become very cold
it is a serious problem
it is dark in that room
it is just five o'clock
it is likely to be fine
it is not for beginners
it is rather warm today
it is soft to the touch
it is their only choice
it is very hot at night
it isn't tom's decision
it isn't in my contract
it isn't just a concept
it isn't much of a plan
it isn't very difficult
it just stopped snowing
it kept snowing all day
it looks like tom is ok
it looks like tom is in
it looks like tom is up
it looks like a wedding
it looks too big for me
it makes no sense to me
it may freeze next week
it may rain around noon
it rained all last week
it really was a miracle
it seemed easy at first
it seemed logical to me
it seems like yesterday
it seems that he's fine
it should be no problem
it sounds very exciting
it was sunday yesterday
it was a difficult time
it was a dilemma for me
it was a disappointment
it was a false positive
it was a horrible scene
it was a lovely evening
it was a small incident
it was a strange affair
it was a stupid mistake
it was a terrible scene
it was a very nice show
it was already too late
it was an accident tom
it was an easy decision
it was difficult for me
it was driving me crazy
it was for tom and mary
it was obviously a joke
it was only a bad dream
it was only a nightmare
it was pretty expensive
it was probably nothing
it was raining that day
it was real frustrating
it was really difficult
it was slow and painful
it was too much for tom
it was truly depressing
it was very frustrating
it wasn't a coincidence
it wasn't easy to sleep
it wasn't safe anywhere
it will be a long night
it will get warmer soon
it won't be much longer
it won't take much time
it would be interesting
it wouldn't surprise me
it'll be christmas soon
it'll be very very hot
it'll make a difference
it'll soon be christmas
it'll stop raining soon
it'll take you too long
it's tom who's the boss
it's a bad time to sell
it's a beautiful flower
it's a big country tom
it's a cheap restaurant
it's a crime to do that
it's a delicate problem
it's a difficult matter
it's a family tradition
it's a fascinating read
it's a figure of speech
it's a matter of choice
it's a misunderstanding
it's a quarter till two
it's a question of when
it's a reasonable price
it's a stupid tradition
it's a terrible problem
it's a work in progress
it's about time for bed
it's all going to be ok
it's all the same to me
it's almost six o'clock
it's almost time to eat
it's already night here
it's awfully cold today
it's because i love you
it's been raining a lot
it's completely natural
it's depressing in here
it's fun to play tennis
it's getting ridiculous
it's going to be cloudy
it's going to get worse
it's going to take time
it's great working here
it's happening too fast
it's hard to ignore tom
it's hard to please tom
it's hard to understand
it's in your hands tom
it's just a coincidence
it's just a scratch ok
it's just what i needed
it's late i have to go
it's my biggest problem
it's nearly six o'clock
it's not like you think
it's not much of a plan
it's not rocket science
it's not that difficult
it's not the first time
it's not worth the pain
it's not worth the risk
it's one of the reasons
it's only three o'clock
it's part of the system
it's perfectly harmless
it's popular with women
it's pretty interesting
it's probably a mistake
it's probably a warning
it's raining everywhere
it's really hot in here
it's shocking isn't it
it's so important to me
it's so nice to see you
it's something tom made
it's still not finished
it's still not too late
it's terribly expensive
it's terribly important
it's the logical choice
it's the perfect number
it's the right decision
it's the same as before
it's the same old story
it's time for tom to go
it's time for breakfast
it's time for you to go
it's time to come clean
it's time to go to work
it's time to let tom go
it's time to plan ahead
it's too late to go now
it's unfortunately true
it's up to you to do it
it's very hot isn't it
it's wrong to tell lies
it's your favorite song
japan is a rich country
jump as high as you can
just answer my question
just don't tell anybody
keep tom away from mary
keep tom out of trouble
keep it in a cool place
keep this window closed
kyoto is worth visiting
leave a message please
leave the driving to me
let me finish this game
let me have a try at it
let me introduce myself
let me know the details
let me say what i think
let me talk to somebody
let us know how it goes
let us worry about that
let's all pray together
let's all stay in touch
let's cross our fingers
let's do something good
let's drive to the lake
let's drop by his house
let's eat lunch outside
let's end this nonsense
let's follow his advice
let's forget about that
let's get a group photo
let's get a smaller car
let's give tom a minute
let's go back to boston
let's go out for a walk
let's go out for dinner
let's go somewhere else
let's hope tom is smart
let's hope for the best
let's make a big circle
let's make a phone call
let's not argue anymore
let's not do that again
let's not do this again
let's not talk shop ok
let's see if it happens
let's see if this helps
let's see what happened
let's sing a happy song
let's sit down and talk
let's stick to the plan
let's suppose it's true
let's take another trip
let's talk about safety
let's talk face to face
let's talk in my office
let's try and stay calm
let's try something new
let's try to be serious
let's wait for our turn
let's wait until monday
let's walk to the beach
life is still difficult

i was playing the violin
i was raised in yokohama
i was so happy back then

i was wearing sunglasses
i was willing to do that
i was with tom last week

i'm still very undecided
i'm stuck here in boston
i'm sure tom will be shy
i'm sure everything's ok
i'm sure that isn't true
i'm sure that's not true
i'm sure you'll like tom
i'm surprised to see you
i'm talking on the phone
i'm talking to my sister
i'm thinking of the plan
i'm tired of translating
i'm tired of watching tv
i'm too busy to help tom

i've forgotten about her
i've forgotten something
i've found nothing wrong
i've found something out
i've got a few questions
i've got a job interview
i've got a party tonight
i've got nothing to hide
i've got nothing to lose
i've got plenty of money

i've got to be somewhere
i've got to get it fixed
i've got to go to boston
i've got to leave boston
i've got to speak to tom
i've got work to do here
i've had so much support
i've just read this book
i've just washed the car
i've known tom for years
i've known you for years
i've lost a great friend
i've made some decisions
i've met tom a few times
i've never been defeated
i've never been outgoing
i've never been so moved

i've never felt so alive
i've never felt so loved
i've never forgotten you
i've never killed anyone
i've never spoken to tom
i've never sung with tom
i've never worn a tuxedo
i've only seen tom twice
i've read the first page
i've seen enough for now
i've seen these pictures
i've spent all the money
i've traveled many times
i've written three books
if tom calls wake me up
if you can come with us
if you want to we'll go
in a word life is short
in a word she is guilty
insects have a hard skin
is tom a friend of yours
is tom a good soninlaw
is tom a hero or traitor
is tom coming to kill us
is tom going to be there
is tom going to help you
is tom really a canadian
is tom telling the truth
is a thousand yen enough
is anyone going tomorrow
is it ok to eat this raw
is it really so terrible
is she single or married
is someone coming for us
is that tom's mp3 player
is that a technical term
is that a trick question
is that all tom told you
is that all you remember
is that as heavy as this
is that really important
is that really necessary
is that something for me
is that why you hired me
is the castle open today
is the museum open today
is the rat alive or dead
is this a trick question
is this fish still alive
is this price acceptable
is this really spaghetti
is this sentence correct
is this tea set complete
is this your first visit
is this your idea of fun
is your french improving
is your father a teacher
is your name on the list
is your offer still open
isn't that a girl's name
isn't that the way it is
isn't that too expensive
isn't that what you said
isn't that what you want
isn't that your car tom
it belonged to my father
it belonged to my mother
it can happen to anybody
it caught me by surprise
it didn't cost that much
it didn't look that easy
it didn't seem necessary
it doesn't belong to you
it doesn't cost anything
it doesn't matter to tom
it doesn't mean anything
it doesn't seem possible
it doesn't seem very far
it doesn't work does it
it happened last october
it happened one year ago
it hasn't happened a lot
it is almost ten o'clock
it is going to rain soon
it is no laughing matter
it is not a real mansion
it is not necessarily so
it is not what i ordered
it is nothing but a joke
it is really nice of you
it is smaller than tokyo
it is unfortunately true
it isn't going very well
it isn't our anniversary
it isn't polite to stare
it isn't that bad is it
it isn't you that i hate
it makes no sense at all
it makes you look guilty
it may be your only hope
it meant something to me
it must've been terrible
it rained for three days
it rained hard yesterday
it rained this afternoon
it really was impressive
it reminds me of someone
it seems that he's happy
it should be a challenge
it snowed all last night
it snowed for three days
it sounds simple i know
it still works sometimes
it was a beautiful night
it was a different world
it was a dream come true
it was a family decision
it was a fantastic night
it was a good compromise
it was a mistake to stay
it was a slight increase
it was a tragic accident
it was a very cold night
it was already very late
it was an honest mistake
it was beginning to snow
it was cloudy that night
it was eight meters long
it was just as i thought
it was my responsibility
it was probably my fault
it was quite spectacular
it was raining yesterday
it wasn't a big surprise
it wasn't a pretty sight
it wasn't fun doing that
it wasn't me it was tom
it wasn't that different
it wasn't that expensive
it wasn't the first time
it wasn't what we wanted
it will be fine tomorrow
it will not happen again
it won't be easy for tom
it worked out ok for tom
it works incredibly well
it'll be a fun challenge
it'll be on monday night
it'll start raining soon
it'll take a few minutes
it's ok to make mistakes
it's a beautiful country
it's a big waste of time
it's a complete disaster
it's a new movie theater
it's a question of taste
it's a quote from a book
it's a race against time
it's a risk we must take
it's a risky proposition
it's a sign of the times
it's a thing of the past
it's a very popular game
it's a very strange case
it's about time to start
it's against my religion
it's all over between us
it's been a chaotic week
it's better than nothing
it's got to be a mistake
it's hard to lose weight
it's hot today isn't it
it's junk throw it away
it's just so frustrating
it's likely to rain soon
it's my duty to help you
it's my fault not yours
it's nice to feel wanted
it's no longer available
it's none of my business
it's not about the money
it's not against the law
it's not easy to explain
it's not even on the map
it's not going to change
it's not going to happen
it's not going very well
it's not that bad is it
it's not that big a deal
it's not you that i hate
it's on the bottom shelf
it's only getting bigger
it's out of the question
it's pretty cold outside
it's probably a big list
it's really hard to tell
it's six o'clock already
it's the dry season here
it's the least we can do
it's the same every time
it's time to get serious
it's time to get to work
it's time to get up tom
it's time to go home now
it's time to go to sleep
it's time to say goodbye
it's time to take a bath
it's time to wake tom up
it's too early to decide
it's too early to get up
it's too good to be true
it's too hard to explain
it's unlikely to be true
it's up to you to decide
it's very demanding work
it's very simple really
it's warm enough to swim
it's what tom would want
it's winter in australia
it's working as intended
it's worth investigating
it's worth talking about
it's your responsibility
i feel like eating out
japan has a mild climate
just answer the question
keep these rules in mind
keep this lesson in mind
last night i was at home
latin is a dead language
lean it against the wall
leave me alone will you
leave the engine running
leave your radio at home
let me ask you something
let me check your ticket
let me know by telephone
let me smell your breath
let me tell you my plans
let me think for a while
let's all just calm down
let's ask tom to help us
let's ask some questions
let's catch a quick bite
let's change the subject
let's do it after school
let's drink wine or beer
let's eat somewhere else
let's find another place
let's get away from here
let's get started anyway
let's go early shall we
let's go inside and talk
let's go make fun of tom
let's go out for a drink
let's go outside and eat
let's go somewhere quiet
let's go tell the others
let's have a bite to eat
let's hope tom was right
let's keep this a secret
let's light some candles
let's not forget it tom
let's not get distracted
let's not worry about it
let's paint the town red
let's play hide and seek
let's play some football
let's pretend we're busy
let's see how this works
let's see if tom is here
let's see what i can get
let's see what'll happen
let's send them all home
let's sit somewhere else
let's stop for ice cream
let's take a little walk
let's take a short break
let's take some pictures
let's take the short cut
let's turn on the heater
let's visit boston first
let's wait till he comes
let's work together here
life can get complicated
life goes by pretty fast
life isn't always simple
listen to this song tom
listen to your wife tom
looks are not everything
many americans are obese
many people believe that
many roads remain closed
many things have changed
mary can't have children
mary had to go to school
mary has a new boyfriend
mary has stopped smoking

mary is tom's girlfriend
mary is a beautiful girl
mary is extremely pretty
mary is getting prettier
mary is kind of charming
mary is quite attractive
mary is wearing earrings
mary isn't my girlfriend
mary looked in her purse

was tom faster than mary
was tom happy doing that
was tom laughing at mary
was it an honest mistake
was it difficult for you
was it difficult to make
was it something special
was that really worth it
wash your face and hands
wasn't tom here with you
we absolutely have to go
we accept your challenge
we all have dark secrets
we appreciate his talent
we are in the same class
we are invited to dinner
we are moving next month
we are worried about you
we believe it's possible
we can leave after lunch
we can't afford mistakes
we can't all be like tom
we can't ask tom to sing
we can't be sure of that
we can't be sure can we
we can't change the past
we can't do such a thing
we can't do this anymore
we can't do what we want
we can't go on like this
we can't just let tom go
we can't leave tom there
we can't leave this here
we can't let this happen
we complained about that
we could all go together
we could help each other
we did what we had to do
we didn't know the truth
we didn't look very long
we didn't play that well
we didn't see tom's face
we didn't want the money
we do very good business
we don't do that anymore
we don't have a daughter
we don't have any choice
we don't have that right
we don't have to do that
we don't have to do this
we don't know each other
we don't know the lyrics
we don't know what it is
we don't know what to do
we don't need assistance

we finally found the key
we found the key at last
we found the right place
we go to church together
we go to school together
we go to the same school
we got up after midnight
we had a little argument
we had a slight accident

we have lunch about noon
we have medicine for you
we have no other options
we have no special plans
we have no time to waste
we have run out of sugar
we have the same dentist
we have the same destiny
we have the same problem
we have to start at once
we have to take the risk
we have very little time
we haven't found tom yet
we haven't got much time
we heard the bomb go off
we intend to change that
we just want to help tom
we just want to help you
we know that tom is here
we know you're the thief
we make butter from milk
we meet here once a week
we missed you last night
we must continue working
we must keep on fighting
we must leave right away
we must leave this place
we must phone the police
we must win at all costs
we naturally got excited
we need tom's leadership
we need some more coffee
we need something to eat
we need to keep fighting
we need to stay together
we only have three hours
we only want to help you
we ordered too much food
we ought to obey the law
we played extremely well
we seem to have lost tom
we should help the needy
we should obey the rules
we should run some tests
we should study together
we shouldn't be together
we shouldn't do anything
we simply have no choice
we still have to do that
we study french together
we tend to make mistakes
we took lots of pictures
we understand each other
we walked across the ice
we want tom at our table
we want a second opinion
we want positive results
we want to do that right
we want you to marry tom
we went there for a week
we went to boston by car

i've never heard tom sing
i've never seen tom dance
i've never seen tom laugh
i've never seen tom naked
i've never studied french
i've never understood tom
i've only been there once
i've said this many times
i've saved a lot of money
i've seen you play tennis
i've shut all six windows
i've stayed away too long
i've suddenly lost weight
i've taken the first step
i've visited boston twice
if i were you i'd buy it
if tom swims i will too
if only he would marry me
if you want to sing sing
if you want to talk talk
in a sense you are right
in a word he is a coward
in other words he's lazy
is tom a canadian citizen
is tom getting any better
is tom going to australia
is tom going to help mary
is tom officially retired
is tom still on the phone
is tom talking to you yet
is tom willing to do that
is everything ok with tom
is everything ok with you
is everything in position
is her hair naturally red
is it ok to freeze cheese
is it a trap of some kind
is it going to rain today
is it something important
is it still far from here
is money important to you
is she your only daughter
is something on your mind
is that all it would take
is that really your fault
is that the way to answer
is that what tom told you
is that what you told tom
is that who i think it is
is that why you called me
is the bank far from here
is the cafeteria open yet
is the staff professional
is the zoo open on monday
is this french or english
is this tom's handwriting
is this information right
is this plane on schedule
is this some kind of test
is this some sort of joke
is this something special
is this the train station
is your father's name tom
is your homework finished
is your neighborhood safe
isn't it a lovely morning
isn't that tom's daughter
it can be used as a knife
it costs an arm and a leg
it could be a big problem
it depends on the weather
it didn't happen that way
it doesn't make tom happy
it doesn't matter so much
it doesn't seem to matter
it doesn't seem very fair
it doesn't sound like tom
it doesn't sound too hard
it doesn't work very well
it gets better every year
it grew larger and larger
it hadn't crossed my mind
it hurt but i didn't cry
it is a difficult problem
it is easy for me to swim
it is good to be a winner
it is impossible to do it
it is jelly that he likes
it is no use trying again
it is quiet here at night
it is still light outside
it is usually hot in july
it is what everybody says
it is wrong to tell a lie
it is you who is to blame
it isn't christmas is it
it isn't a real apartment
it isn't always like that
it isn't always like this
it isn't going to be easy
it isn't going to be long
it isn't that complicated
it isn't too late for you
it isn't too spicy is it
it isn't very complicated
it looked similar to this
it looks like tom is here
it looks like tom is rich
it looks like tom may win
it made me laugh out loud
it makes a big difference
it makes me kind of happy
it may or may not be true
it must be here somewhere
it must've cost a fortune
it nearly cost me my life
it rains a lot in okinawa
it really is a good price
it really was spectacular
it seems he's still alive
it seems that tom is sick
it seems to be going well
it seems very interesting
it shouldn't be a problem
it shouldn't be like that
it shouldn't be like this
it shouldn't happen again
it was a complete failure
it was a complete success
it was a good opportunity
it was a great blow to us
it was a stroke of genius
it was a terrible tragedy
it was our responsibility
it was raining last night
it was super embarrassing
it was time for breakfast
it was very disappointing
it wasn't a job interview
it wasn't important to me
it wasn't meant as a joke
it will be very expensive
it will be very very hot
it will cool down tonight
it won't cost us anything
it wouldn't hurt to smile
it'll be better next time
it'll soon be six o'clock
it's ok to be scared tom
it's a beautiful painting
it's a big responsibility
it's a complicated matter
it's a delicate situation
it's a difficult language
it's a drop in the bucket
it's a fascinating theory
it's a long way to boston
it's a nice day isn't it
it's a very serious crime
it's a very serious issue
it's a very special place
it's a waste of resources
it's actually a good idea
it's actually kind of fun
it's actually very simple
it's all coming to an end
it's all going to be fine
it's almost midnight here
it's almost three o'clock
it's already dark outside
it's always been that way
it's always been this way
it's an ambitious project
it's an error in judgment
it's been snowing all day
it's clear tom is unhappy
it's definitely a problem
it's difficult being rich
it's difficult to explain
it's easy to eat too much
it's for a friend of mine
it's fun to play baseball
it's getting on my nerves
it's going to happen soon
it's going to take months
it's happening to me too
it's hard not to like tom
it's hard to stop smoking
it's hard to surprise you
it's hidden under the bed
it's incredible isn't it
it's incredibly beautiful
it's just a job you know
it's just a waste of time
it's just not appropriate
it's just started to snow
it's kind of a long story
it's much more convenient
it's much worse than that
it's my turn to work late
it's nearly three o'clock
it's never happened to me
it's not christmas is it
it's not ok to smoke here
it's not a good situation
it's not a perfect system
it's not a secret anymore
it's not a trick question
it's not always like that
it's not always like this
it's not an easy question
it's not anything serious
it's not difficult for me
it's not going to be easy
it's not going to be long
it's not something i'd do
it's not that complicated
it's not very complicated
it's not very windy today
it's only a temporary fix
it's pretty disappointing
it's pretty hot isn't it
it's quarter to eight now
it's raining hard tonight
it's really very annoying
it's simple but it works
it's such a beautiful day
it's such a waste of time
it's the least i could do
it's the third of october
it's time to do something
it's time to feed the dog
it's time to go back home
it's time to go to school
it's time to stop waiting
it's time you went to bed
it's too difficult for me
it's too late to help tom
it's too late to try that
it's totally dark outside
it's true that she's dead
it's unclear how tom died
it's very crowded in here
it's very humid isn't it
it's very important to us
it's virtually impossible
it's warm today isn't it
it's way too cold to swim
it's worse than you think
it's your duty to do that
it's your fault not mine
it's your money isn't it
jeans take forever to dry
just a minute i'm coming
keep your classroom clean
keep your fingers crossed
lay the book on the table
learning french is useful
leave that to the experts
leave the poor girl alone
leaves fall in the autumn

let tom do the dirty work
let tom sleep on my couch
let me go be with my wife
let me go in place of him
let me pay for the dinner
let me see what you wrote
let me tell you about tom
let me think for a minute
let me try to talk to tom
let's assume tom is right
let's begin with lesson 3
let's continue to do this
let's discuss our options
let's do it when he comes
let's get tom out of here
let's get a cup of coffee
let's get out of the taxi
let's get ready for lunch
let's get rid of that one
let's give tom his reward
let's go and surprise tom
let's go do something fun
let's go fishing with tom
let's go outside and play
let's go outside and talk
let's go to the mountains
let's have a pillow fight
let's help each other out
let's hope tom isn't dead
let's hope he's all right
let's hope it still works
let's just get rid of tom
let's just talk about you
let's make the most of it
let's meet at the station
let's not forget the beer
let's not get discouraged
let's not talk about that

let's see how tom does it
let's see if tom can help

that book costs 3000 yen
that book was interesting
that car is a real beauty
that chimney is very high
that didn't really happen
that doesn't happen a lot
that doesn't happen often
that doesn't matter to me
that dog has a short tail
that fact can't be denied
that film is for children
that girl's eyes are blue
that happens to all of us
that house belongs to him
that is likely what i saw
that is rather unexpected
that isn't an orange tree
that isn't very important
that isn't what tom wants
that made me think of you
that makes a lot of sense
that may not be necessary
that might be kind of fun
that must be tom's mother
that must be a new record
that name sounds familiar
that never happened to me
that plan is unacceptable
that rumor spread quickly
that seems understandable
that should be no problem
that should be prohibited
that sounds like a threat
that sounds strange to me
that store closed in 2013
that street is very noisy
that tie is too expensive
that tie really suits you
that was tom on the phone
that was a delicious meal
that was a disappointment
that was a lie wasn't it
that was a nasty surprise
that was a special moment
that was a tough decision
that was a very sad story
that was a waste of money
that was everything i had
that was just an accident
that was perfectly normal
that was really beautiful
that was really difficult
that was three months ago
that was why tom screamed
that was wrong of course
that wasn't very romantic
that woman's got two bags
that woman's name is mary
that won't be good enough
that won't make tom happy
that won't solve anything
that would be a good idea
that would be my response
that would help me decide
that'll cost thirty euros
that'll give us more time
that'll put you in danger
that'll remain our secret
that's a complex question
that's a delicate problem
that's a depressing story
that's a really big apple
that's a reasonable price
that's a strange question
that's absolutely correct
that's all i can tell you
that's all i have to know
that's all i need to hear
that's all i was thinking
that's all tom had to say
that's all tom said to me
that's an unusual request
that's awful sweet of you
that's certainly possible
that's just irresponsible
that's just what i wanted
that's my favorite saying
that's my sister's camera
that's no longer possible
that's not a bad question
that's not a real problem
that's not an orange tree
that's not much of a plan
that's not what i ordered
that's not what tom wants
that's our plan right now
that's pretty easy to fix
that's pretty encouraging
that's probably a mistake
that's the absolute truth
that's the real challenge
that's thirty meters long
that's very mature of you
that's what i want to ask
that's what tom has to do
that's what tom remembers
that's what tom should do
that's what everyone does
that's where i want to go
that's why tom is winning

i'm afraid you're mistaken
i'm always busy these days
i'm always willing to help
i'm aware of the situation
i'm beginning to get tired
i'm content with my salary
i'm convinced tom is lying
i'm doing everything i can

i'm only three blocks away
i'm originally from boston
i'm painting an easter egg
i'm prepared for the worst
i'm pretty angry right now

i'm teaching french to tom
i'm telling the truth tom
i'm the one who helped tom

i'm the same age as tom is
i'm the same weight as tom
i'm tired of your comments
i'm translating an article
i'm usually pretty patient
i'm very disturbed by this
i'm very grateful for that
i'm very likely to be late
i'm very sorry that i lied
i'm very thankful for that
i'm very worried about tom
i'm waiting to talk to tom
i'm well aware of the risk
i'm working at a gift shop
i'm working on my computer
i'm worried about tom too
i've already been punished
i've already had my supper
i've already spoken to tom
i've already talked to tom
i've always been a dreamer
i've always hated the cold
i've always hated the dark
i've always wanted a child
i've been here over a year
i've been living in a cave
i've been married too long
i've been to boston before
i've been to the dentist's
i've been very very lucky
i've begun studying french
i've brought you something
i've come to take you home
i've come to talk with you
i've done all this for you
i've done this all my life
i've drunk too much coffee
i've forgotten your number
i've got a better solution
i've got a criminal record
i've got a meeting at 230
i've got a message for you
i've got a pain in my side
i've got a project for you
i've got everything i want
i've got my dog in the car
i've got nothing to report
i've got plenty of friends
i've got something for tom
i've got to cut tom's hair
i've got to go to the bank
i've had a lot of practice
i've had too much to drink
i've heard a lot about you
i've helped a lot i think
i've just finished my work
i've just finished packing
i've known tom a long time
i've learned from the best
i've lost the will to live
i've made a lot of enemies
i've made so many mistakes
i've met tom several times
i've met the perfect woman
i've never been more proud
i've never danced with tom
i've never had a nightmare
i've never seen a real cow
i've never stolen anything
i've never used a chainsaw
i've often heard about you
i've read all the comments
i've read both these books
i've read this book before
i've returned to australia
i've seen this movie twice
i've sent a package to you
i've told tom where we are
i've visited boston before
ice skating is kind of fun
if i were you i'd hit tom
if tom dies what'll we do
if tom wins i'll be happy
if it rains he won't come
if we hurry we'll make it
if you want to go then go
if you're happy i'm happy
if you're hungry then eat
in any case it's too late
in my opinion tom's right
in my opinion he is wrong
in other words he is lazy
is french taught at school
is tom allergic to peanuts
is tom always this helpful
is tom in a lot of trouble
is tom lying about his age
is tom one of your friends
is tom still able to drive
is anybody looking for you
is eating whale meat wrong
is everything satisfactory
is he in favor of the plan
is it ok if i call you tom
is it hard to learn french
is it possible to help tom
is it true you got married
is it your first trip here
is now a good time to talk
is one thousand yen enough
is someone waiting for you
is something bothering you
is ten thousand yen enough
is that a cow or a buffalo
is that really tom's fault
is that supposed to happen
is that the best we can do
is that the remote control
is that what you want tom
is that what you're asking
is the mouse dead or alive
is the snake alive or dead
is this actually happening
is this ball yours or hers
is this door always locked
is this something you want
is this word in common use
is this your favorite song
is what you told me secret
is your father at home now
is your mother at home now
isn't it about time to eat
isn't that skirt too short
isn't that what tom wanted
isn't that what you wanted
isn't this kind of obvious
isn't this what you wanted
it actually is interesting
it cost 30 million dollars
it didn't seem appropriate
it feels weird doesn't it
it happened more than once
it happened quite recently
it has snowed for two days
it is already nine o'clock
it is cheaper to go by bus
it is especially hot today
it is five minutes to nine
it is fun to play baseball
it is getting dark outside
it is getting on my nerves
it is just half past seven
it is kind of you to do so
it is likely to rain again
it is likely to rain today
it is raining all the time
it is raining hard outside
it is said that he is sick
it is time that you got up
it is time to go to school
it is you who are to blame
it isn't a matter of price
it isn't attractive at all
it isn't going well is it
it isn't important anymore
it isn't too far from here
it isn't written in french
it looks like tom is alive
it looks like tom is angry
it looks like tom is awake
it looks like tom is bored
it may snow in the evening
it might be useful one day
it might snow this evening
it might tell us something
it moved closer and closer
it must be hard to do that
it must have been terrible
it only weighs 3 kilograms
it reminds me of something
it seemed almost dangerous
it seemed pretty important
it seemed that he was fine
it seems interesting to me
it seems like you hate tom
it seems that tom is lying
it should be ready shortly
it shouldn't have happened
it still happens sometimes
it sure sounds interesting
it was tom who kissed mary
it was a beautiful evening
it was a complete disaster
it was a fun game to watch
it was a great shock to me
it was a race against time
it was a terrible accident
it was a terrible disaster
it was a wonderful evening
it was a wonderful feeling
it was an innocent mistake
it was clear tom was lying
it was fun while it lasted
it was incredibly romantic
it was just my imagination
it was love at first sight
it was my fault not tom's
it was nice of tom to help
it was one of those things
it was really a lot of fun
it was really embarrassing
it was the best party ever
it was too cold to do that
it wasn't tom who did that
it wasn't always like that
it wasn't much of a bridge
it will never happen again
it won't cost you anything
it'll be our little secret
it'll be very hot tomorrow
it'll happen quite quickly
it's ok to be disappointed
it's tom who's the problem
it's tom's first time here
it's a complicated subject
it's a different situation
it's a good plan isn't it
it's a nice day for a walk
it's a pleasure to be here
it's a questionable policy
it's a quote from the book
it's a very big difference
it's a very complex system
it's a very important step
it's a very simple process
it's a very touching story
it's already three o'clock
it's always been like that
it's an easy plant to grow
it's been a very rough day
it's been raining all week
it's been very frustrating
it's been very interesting
it's complicated isn't it
it's complicated you know
it's difficult to describe
it's easier than i thought
it's easier than you think
it's easy to work in jeans
it's enough for three days
it's exactly as i expected
it's exactly what i wanted
it's extremely interesting
it's going to be corrected
it's going to be dangerous
it's going to be dark soon
it's going to be hot today
it's going to be over soon
it's going to be very hard
it's going to happen today
it's going to have to wait
it's going to rain tonight
it's got to work this time
it's hard to change people
it's hard to master french
it's hard to say no to you
it's his problem not mine
it's important we find tom
it's interesting isn't it
it's just a matter of time
it's just like a nightmare
it's just your imagination
it's kind of close to here
it's kind of hot isn't it
it's late already go home
it's like i always thought
it's much bigger than that
it's much too cold to swim
it's my job to protect you
it's my picture not yours
it's my problem not yours
it's my turn to drive next
it's none of your business
it's not a matter of price
it's not at all surprising
it's not cheap to eat here
it's not important anymore
it's not like that anymore
it's not too far from here
it's not written in french
it's nothing extraordinary
it's nothing personal tom
it's obvious that tom lied
it's only a matter of time
it's popular with students
it's pretty cold isn't it
it's raining cats and dogs
it's really going to be ok
it's really hard to choose
it's simply too cold today
it's the next logical step
it's the same for everyone
it's time for tom to leave
it's time to get a haircut
it's time to go to the gym
it's time to hit the books
it's time to stop fighting
it's too early to call tom
it's too late to visit tom
it's unlikely tom will win
it's very important to tom
it's very small and narrow
japan is a strange country
japan is an island country
japan is full of surprises
keep money in a safe place
keep the cat off the couch
keep your eyes on the road
languages change over time
learn these names by heart
learning french takes time
learning new things is fun
let tom make the decisions
let me pay for your coffee
let me take a quick shower
let us forget this problem
let us know what you think
let's all get back to work
let's allow tom to do that
let's check with an expert
let's do this first of all
let's drink to your health
let's eat out for a change
let's eat out this evening
let's eat together tonight
let's get back to business
let's get back to the boat
let's get back to the ship
let's get discount tickets
let's get out of here fast
let's get ready for school
let's get something to eat
let's get together tonight
let's go and see him there
let's go back to australia
let's go back to the motel
let's go upstairs and talk
let's have a picture taken
let's just go to my office
let's make a snowman later
let's not keep tom waiting
let's play a game of chess
let's play this game again
let's see what can be done
let's sing that song again
let's split the bill today
let's stop and take a rest
let's talk about happiness
let's talk before fighting
let's try another approach
let's try it with this one

maybe i'm working too much
maybe tom can speak french
maybe tom can teach french
maybe tom didn't have time

maybe it wasn't so obvious
maybe it's the same person
maybe that will change now

is tom also studying french
is tom aware of what he did

is tom good at playing golf
is anyone going to eat that
is eating fish good for you
is everything ok between us
is he a doctor or a patient
is it ok if i drink alcohol
is it always cold like this
is it hard to speak english
is it included in the price
is it made of wood or metal
is it really so complicated
is it so difficult to write
is that enough for you tom
is that the belt i gave you
is that the best you can do
is that what tom taught you
is that what tom would want
is the dining room open now
is this a good time to talk
is this information correct
is this made in switzerland
is this the best tom can do
is this the best you can do
is this translation correct
is your mother still living
is your school in this town
isn't that what i just said
it actually wasn't that bad
it always happens like this
it could've been much worse
it depends on the situation
it does more harm than good
it doesn't change the facts
it doesn't have any meaning
it doesn't make sense to me
it gives me something to do
it happened a long time ago
it happened over a year ago
it happened that he was out
it has had no effect on him
it is a very strange letter
it is clear that he is rich
it is easier than i thought
it is easy to work in jeans
it is hard to recognize you
it is ten minutes to eleven
it is time to shut the gate
it isn't tom's fault is it
it isn't as if we were rich
it isn't easy to train dogs
it isn't illegal to do that
it isn't very far from here
it just doesn't seem likely
it looks like tom is asleep
it looks like tom was right
it looks like tom was wrong
it looks like tom won't win
it looks like nobody's home
it makes all the difference
it may be that tom is there
it may not be a coincidence
it never should've happened
it only takes a few minutes
it rained yesterday evening
it really gets on my nerves
it seems the strike is over
it seems to be a good house
it should be fairly obvious
it shouldn't be much longer
it snowed all day yesterday
it sounded like a dream job
it sounds like a lot of fun
it suddenly started raining
it was a disappointing loss
it was a mistake to do that
it was a nice day yesterday
it was about twenty dollars
it was all your imagination
it was entirely tom's fault
it was his personal opinion
it was incredibly dangerous
it was just what tom wanted
it was late so i went home
it was not an easy decision
it was rather easy for them
it was supposed to be funny
it was wonderful wasn't it
it will be over in a moment
it would be a difficult job
it would be nice to do that
it'll soon be three o'clock
it's a complicated question
it's a kind of pretty place
it's a matter of priorities
it's a town of 3000 people
it's a very difficult issue
it's a very serious illness
it's a very serious problem
it's about time i was going
it's almost time for dinner
it's already out of fashion
it's been snowing all night
it's best if you don't know
it's best to tell the truth
it's boring to stay at home
it's cheaper to go by train
it's definitely a good sign
it's different for everyone
it's difficult to find work
it's difficult to sing well
it's eight o'clock at night
it's extremely embarrassing
it's fun to speak in french
it's fun to watch you dance
it's getting out of control
it's going to be a busy day
it's going to be a nice day
it's going to be very tough
it's going to clear up soon
it's going to get dark soon
it's going to get warm soon
it's going to rain for sure
it's going to rain tomorrow
it's going to snow tomorrow
it's going to take too long
it's going to work for sure
it's good that it's snowing
it's great to have a family
it's hard for me to do that
it's illegal to buy cocaine
it's impossible to describe
it's like a dream come true
it's my third day in boston
it's never been done before
it's nice of you to help me
it's nice to be appreciated
it's none of tom's business
it's not tom's fault is it
it's not a computer problem
it's not easy to train dogs
it's not hard for everybody
it's not hard to understand
it's not my problem anymore
it's not so easy to do that
it's not supposed to be fun
it's not that far from here
it's not very far from here
it's nothing i can't handle
it's nothing to worry about
it's only taken three years
it's possible tom was lying
it's pretty easy to imagine
it's probably past midnight
it's really important to me
it's six degrees below zero
it's somewhere in this room
it's starting to rain again
it's time for us to go home
it's time to prepare dinner
it's very important to vote
it's water under the bridge
it's well worth the trouble
it's what i'm used to doing
it's your problem not mine
keep an eye on my suitcases
leave us alone for a moment
let me ask you one question

let's go somewhere far away
let's go to boston together
let's go to boston with tom
let's go tomorrow afternoon
let's go visit tom tomorrow
let's hope tom is listening
let's hope for good results
let's hope that that's true
let's just get back to work
let's make it three o'clock
let's not deceive ourselves
let's not forget who tom is
let's not talk about boston
let's not talk about it now
let's not waste this chance
let's play a different game
let's sit at the same table
let's start the meeting now
let's start with lesson ten
let's talk about basketball
let's talk about the future
let's talk about this later

that boy has a great talent
that could happen to anyone
that didn't change anything
that doesn't happen anymore
that doesn't have to happen
that doesn't matter anymore
that doesn't matter really
that doesn't sound familiar
that flag is very beautiful
that girl has a lovely doll
that girl is very beautiful
that girl looks very pretty
that he is alive is certain
that is out of the question
that isn't a terrible thing
that isn't necessary is it
that looks suspicious to me
that loud music is annoying
that makes a big difference
that might happen on monday
that old man must be insane
that question is irrelevant
that result was predictable
that room is not very large
that seems reasonable to me
that seems suspicious to me
that shouldn't be a problem
that small one is also mine
that sounds too complicated
that town is two miles away
that usually doesn't happen
that was a beautiful speech
that was a fun conversation
that was an interesting day
that was my biggest problem
that was my idea not tom's
that was never there before
that was really interesting
that was something i wanted
that wasn't on the schedule
that wasn't so hard was it
that woman must be his wife
that won't happen on monday
that would be extraordinary
that would be inappropriate
that'll be something to see
that'll bring the cost down
that's a beautiful painting
that's a good thing to have
that's a small price to pay
that's all i'm going to say
that's all tom thinks about
that's all that's important
that's all you need to know
that's always a big concern
that's convenient isn't it
that's everything isn't it
that's exactly what i'd say
that's exactly what tom did
that's extremely surprising
that's going to happen soon
that's how it's always been
that's never happened to me
that's not an issue anymore
that's not common knowledge
that's not for me to decide
that's not going to be easy
that's not going to stop me
that's not the case anymore
that's not the problem here
that's not the real problem
that's not why tom resigned
that's one of my weaknesses
that's one secret i'll keep
that's quite understandable
that's really immature tom
that's something i can't do
that's the only possibility
that's the price of success
that's the problem with tom
that's the problem i think
that's the story of my life
that's too expensive for us
that's very common actually
that's very difficult to do
that's very generous of you
that's very important to us
that's what i wanted to ask
that's what i'm looking for
that's what tom always does
that's what tom had in mind
that's what tom likes to do
that's what friends are for
that's what sisters are for
that's what smart people do
that's what they always say

i hope it doesn't rain today
i hope it doesn't snow today
i hope no one feels that way
i hope no one takes my tools
i hope nothing's been broken
i hope somebody will do that
i hope that you will like it
i hope the meeting went well
i hope they don't torture us
i hope this can help someone
i hope this is going to work
i hope this is the right one
i hope you'll answer me soon

i wonder what tom will think
i wonder what else tom wants
i wonder who bought the cake
i wonder whose idea this was
i wonder why tom is so timid
i wonder why tom is so tired
i wonder why they picked tom
i work better under pressure
i worked on it day after day

i'm 100 sure of my decision
i'm tom and i'm an alcoholic
i'm a student but tom isn't
i'm about to push the button
i'm actually enjoying myself
i'm actually paid to do this
i'm afraid i've got bad news
i'm afraid tom might do that
i'm afraid tom will get lost
i'm afraid it's too late now
i'm afraid that might happen

i'm not sure when he'll come
i'm not too happy about that
i'm not very good at singing
i'm not yet ready to do that
i'm not your husband anymore
i'm not your teacher anymore
i'm on my way to the station
i'm only happy when it rains
i'm pretty sure tom has died
i'm pretty sure tom is right
i'm pretty sure tom will win
i'm quite sure tom won't win
i'm ready to do that for you
i'm really proud of our team
i'm really worried about tom
i'm saving this seat for tom
i'm secretly hoping for that
i'm sick of this hot weather
i'm sorry that i lied to you

i'm speaking from experience
i'm speaking with my student
i'm still not happy about it
i'm still thinking about tom

i'm willing to give it a try
i'm with my family right now
i'm working as fast as i can
i'm working on a big project
i'm worried about everything
i'm writing a song in french
i've already eaten breakfast
i've already filed my report
i've already finished dinner
i've already heard this joke
i've already read that novel
i've already seen that movie
i've already spoken with tom
i've always admired you tom
i've always hated that color
i've always hated this place
i've always wanted to try it
i've attempted suicide twice
i've been bitten a few times
i've been sentenced to death
i've been to the supermarket
i've been trying to find tom
i've brought a cup of coffee
i've considered your request
i've decided to go to boston
i've decided to leave boston
i've decided to study french
i've finally made up my mind
i've fixed the radio for him
i've got a frog in my throat
i've got a lot more to learn
i've got a lot of good ideas
i've got a university degree
i've got a wife and children
i've got no secrets from tom
i've got nothing else to say
i've got nothing more to say
i've got nothing to give you
i've got nothing to tell you
i've got reservations for us
i've got to get to a meeting
i've got to go to the police
i've gotten older haven't i
i've had enough of your help
i've heard so much about tom
i've heard that sound before
i've heard this story before
i've learned a lot about tom
i've made a horrible mistake
i've made a terrible mistake
i've made lunch reservations
i've never been to a funeral
i've never been to that town
i've never flown first class
i've never met tom's parents
i've never missed a deadline
i've never seen tom so angry
i've never seen a live whale
i've never trusted strangers
i've saved the best for last
i've seen tom quite recently
i've started learning french
i've tried everything i know
i've visited boston with tom
if i could help you i would
if i don't do this who will
if i knew that i'd tell you
if i were you i'd ignore it
if only i'd done my homework
if you don't eat you'll die
if you need me to i'll come
if you want to come you can
in case it rains i won't go
in my opinion he is correct
in my opinion you are wrong
interest rates are still low
is tom able to drive a truck
is tom asking too much of us
is tom going to do it or not
is tom going to school today
is tom going to swim with us
is tom really mary's husband
is tom still studying french
is tom still working for you
is it ok if i don't eat this
is it ok if i hold your hand
is it ok if i kiss your wife
is it all right if i come in
is it almost time for dinner
is my french really that bad
is someone taking care of it
is that absolutely necessary
is that all you want to know
is that an original painting
is that not possible anymore
is that really so outrageous
is that really what tom said
is that what tom said or not
is the battery fully charged
is the customer always right
is this the train for london
is this your first time here
is your father in the garden
is your school far from here
isn't it too late to do that
isn't that kind of dangerous
isn't this against the rules
it became her turn to listen
it doesn't bother me anymore
it doesn't happen very often
it has nothing to do with me
it has to be there somewhere
it is a pity you cannot come
it is about time i was going
it is dangerous to swim here
it is easy to read this book
it is far from here to tokyo
it is fun to swim in the sea
it is going to be quite cold
it is kind of you to help me
it is not easy to train dogs
it is odd that he is so late
it is time to study japanese
it is useless to talk to him
it is very cold this morning
it isn't a difficult concept
it isn't a difficult problem
it isn't easy for you is it
it isn't physically possible
it isn't time to do that yet
it isn't too far from boston
it isn't too hard to do that
it kept raining all day long
it looks like tom is annoyed
it looks like tom is excited
it looks like tom is furious
it looks like tom is healthy
it looks like tom is jealous
it looks like tom is leaving
it looks like tom is nervous
it looks like tom is unhappy
it looks like tom is winning
it looks like tom is worried
it looks like tom isn't here
it looks like a heart attack
it looks like we're all here
it makes me want to throw up
it may snow in the afternoon
it might rain this afternoon
it must've happened that way
it seemed like a game to tom
it seems it'll rain tomorrow
it seems like tom is in love
it seems that he's a student
it seems too good to be true
it seems too much to me too
it tastes a lot like chicken
it was tom's fault you know
it was a calm winter evening
it was almost like christmas
it was an extraordinary year
it was an unfortunate choice
it was anything but pleasant
it was dark under the bridge
it was disappointing to lose
it was hard for me to say no
it was harder than i thought
it was her fate to die young
it was inevitable wasn't it
it was just a matter of time
it was nice to see you again
it was not easy to find gold
it was quite difficult to do
it was very hot this morning
it wasn't interesting at all
it wasn't like that at first
it won't be easy telling tom
it won't necessarily be easy
it won't take me a long time
it would be stupid to say no
it would be wrong to do that
it wouldn't be too difficult
it'll be an interesting game
it'll be dark in a few hours
it'll be fun to visit boston
it'll be possible to do that
it'll happen i'm sure of it
it's ok if you don't do that
it's ok to do that isn't it
it's a cruel world out there
it's a very complex question
it's a very dangerous system
it's about time to go to bed
it's all right now isn't it
it's all that really matters
it's already time to go home
it's amazing what can happen
it's an embarrassing illness
it's an exciting proposition
it's an impossible situation
it's an interesting argument
it's an unpredictable market
it's been a bad week for tom
it's clear that you're wrong
it's cloudy but not raining
it's easy to tell them apart
it's getting worse and worse
it's going to be a long wait
it's going to be frustrating
it's going to be interesting
it's going to be lots of fun
it's going to happen tonight
it's good you should try it
it's hard being a politician
it's illegal to do that here
it's important to read books
it's likely to rain tomorrow
it's much too dangerous here
it's necessary for you to go
it's never too late to learn
it's not a difficult problem
it's not as bad as it sounds
it's not as easy as it looks
it's not like tom to be late
it's not like you to be late
it's not time to do that yet
it's not time to go home yet
it's not too far from boston
it's not too hard to do that
it's not worth arguing about
it's obvious that he's wrong
it's obvious that she's sick
it's our third day in boston
it's possible tom won't come
it's pretty hot this morning
it's rude to point at anyone
it's smaller than i remember
it's so nice to stay at home
it's still snowing in boston
it's still too early to tell
it's the logical thing to do
it's the size of a small car
it's the thought that counts
it's their problem not ours
it's time for tom to wake up
it's time for you to wake up
it's time to make a decision
it's time to show your cards
it's time to stop doing that
it's too cold to do that now
it's too late to do that now
it's way too late to do that

that girl has become a woman
that happened just last week
that happened three days ago

is tom going to press charges
is tom really going to boston
is tom really married to mary
is tom still a french teacher
is tom still living in boston
is basketball season over yet
is everyone here with the cia
is he aware of the difficulty
is it christmas again already
is it ok to smoke around here
is it far from here to boston
is it safe to eat cockroaches
is it you who'll buy the food
is that a request or an order
is that supposed to be a joke
is that too expensive for you
is that what you have in mind
is that what you wanted to do
is the supermarket still open
is there anything left to say
is this going to be a problem
is this really such a problem
is this really that important
is this store open on sundays
is this the best you could do
is this to eat here or to go
is your freezer still working
is your friend still sleeping
isn't that what you just said
isn't this weather just great
it actually isn't that simple
it all depends on the weather
it can't be that easy can it
it doesn't seem fair does it
it doesn't work that way tom
it has never been done before
it has nothing to do with tom
it has nothing to do with you
it is clear that he is guilty
it is fun to speak in english
it is going to rain very soon
it is likely to rain tomorrow
it is never too late to learn
it is no use arguing with her
it is no use arguing with him
it is no use asking him again
it is no use talking with him
it is time for her to go home
it is time you went to school
it is twenty minutes past ten
it isn't as easy as it sounds
it isn't like i haven't tried
it just doesn't seem possible
it leaves a lot to be desired
it looks like tom was correct
it looks like it'll rain soon
it might not be a coincidence
it rained for hours and hours
it rained yesterday afternoon
it really happened didn't it
it reminds me of my childhood
it seemed like you were happy
it seems i have a slight cold
it seems that tom wants to go
it was a beautiful spring day
it was a big misunderstanding
it was a quiet winter evening
it was a very stupid decision
it was all a misunderstanding
it was an unfortunate mistake
it was blowing hard all night
it was easy for me to do that
it was everything i hoped for
it was going to be a surprise
it was hard for tom to say no
it was kind of you to help me
it was like christmas morning
it was like a dream come true
it was never a problem before
it was nice chatting with you
it was nice to speak with her
it was not a complete victory
it was pretty easy to do that
it was raining around chicago
it was raining hard in boston
it was very cold that evening
it wasn't me who insulted you
it will be winter before long
it would be stupid to say yes
it'll be a difficult decision
it'll be difficult to do that
it'll be hard to persuade tom
it'll be interesting for sure
it'll only make matters worse
it'll soon be time for dinner
it's a good thing i came here
it's a good thing tom is here
it's a great day for a picnic
it's a luxury we can't afford
it's a pleasant day isn't it
it's a very chaotic situation
it's a very comfortable house
it's a very delicate question
it's a very important message
it's about the size of an egg
it's an embarrassing question
it's been nice talking to you
it's best not to talk so much
it's difficult to talk to tom
it's divided into three parts
it's fun hanging out with tom
it's fun to hang out with tom
it's fun to ride a motorcycle
it's going to be cold tonight
it's going to be embarrassing
it's going to be hot tomorrow
it's gradually getting colder
it's important that i do this
it's impossible to go out now
it's nice to see tom so happy
it's no secret i hate ironing
it's not a difficult question
it's not a permanent solution
it's not as easy as you think
it's not easy to speak french
it's not especially hot today
it's not going to work is it
it's not just a minor problem
it's not like i haven't tried
it's not really a competition
it's not something we planned
it's not the end of the world
it's nothing to be ashamed of
it's perfectly understandable
it's quite an unusual concept
it's really bad for your eyes
it's relatively simple to use
it's strange don't you think
it's time for us to get going
it's time to change direction
it's time to leave for school
it's time to leave this place
it's too early to really tell
it's too hot to go for a walk
it's too late to go there now
it's too soon to discuss that
it's unlikely tom will return
it's very hot today isn't it
it's what tom would've wanted
japan is not as big as canada
japan is to the east of china
japanese history interests me

let's make it some other time
let's meet tom at the station
let's not even think about it
let's not forget human rights
let's organize a search party
let's play a game of baseball
let's see how things work out
let's see if anything changes
let's see what you're made of
let's stop talking about this
let's take a break for coffee
let's talk about that tonight
let's try doing this together
let's try something different
let's try to be more tolerant
let's try to reason with them
let's turn off the television
life is not all fun and games

that boy speaks like an adult
that bridge is very beautiful
that doesn't make sense to me
that doesn't seem right to me
that doesn't seem very heroic
that doesn't surprise me much
that dress is perfect for you
that happened over a year ago
that happened three years ago
that is not much of a problem
that is not the case in japan
that isn't the correct answer
that looks somewhat dangerous
that made perfect sense to me
that makes everything simpler
that might be difficult to do
that museum is worth visiting
that music gets on his nerves
that never should've happened

that's apparently not a crime
that's better than we thought
that's classified information
that's clearly not a priority
that's exactly what i thought
that's how we do it in boston
that's my favorite expression
that's not the correct answer
that's not the important part
that's not what i had in mind
that's not what i said at all
that's not what i want to buy
that's not why tom didn't win
that's nothing to worry about
that's pretty hard to believe
that's something i'd never do
that's something that we made
that's such a wonderful thing
that's the solution isn't it
that's totally understandable
that's water under the bridge
that's what i loved about tom

he admitted that he was guilty
he and i are in the same class
he arrived after the bell rang
he behaved as if he were crazy
he broke the window on purpose
he came home three hours later
he came to japan two years ago
he came to ask us for our help
he came to my office yesterday

he earns his living by writing
he entered the garden secretly

he goes to london once a month

i thought tom didn't like cats
i thought tom had already left
i thought tom might be in jail
i thought tom seemed impressed
i thought tom was exaggerating
i thought tom was your surgeon
i thought tom would be excited
i thought tom would be nervous
i thought tom would be pleased
i thought tom wouldn't do that
i thought tom wouldn't give up
i thought it was inappropriate
i thought that i smelled bacon
i thought that tom wasn't busy
i thought that he was a doctor
i thought that he was innocent
i thought the same exact thing
i thought this door was locked
i thought we were going to die
i thought we were welcome here
i thought would make it easier
i thought you didn't like them
i thought you enjoyed swimming
i thought you might be curious
i thought you wanted a divorce
i thought you wanted the truth
i thought you wanted this back
i thought you were from boston
i thought you'd be proud of me
i told tom i wasn't interested
i told tom that was ridiculous
i told tom the bank was closed
i told him to keep his promise
i took that picture a week ago
i took this picture a week ago
i tried to explain that to tom
i tried to help my grandfather
i understood almost everything
i used to play a lot of tennis
i used to play here as a child
i used to swim better than tom
i usually don't talk this much
i usually go to bed before ten
i waited more than three hours
i wake up early in the morning
i walk in the forest every day
i walked as far as the station
i want tom arrested for murder
i want tom kept away from here
i want tom to win the election
i want a cup of coffee please
i want answers to my questions
i want my parents not to worry
i want something cold to drink
i want them to be your friends
i want to be a baseball player
i want to be alone for a while
i want to buy something to eat
i want to climb mt fuji again
i want to do something for tom
i want to drink something cold
i want to fly above the clouds
i want to get better at french
i want to have a cup of coffee
i want to hear what tom thinks
i want to know a lot of things
i want to know all the details
i want to know the whole story
i want to know what's going on
i want to live in a small town
i want to play tennis with tom
i want to see him at all costs
i want to see that movie again
i want to talk to him about it
i want to talk to your brother
i want to talk with your uncle
i want you to destroy all this
i want you to listen carefully
i want you to return to boston
i want you to think about that
i wanted tom to clean his room
i wanted tom to do that for me
i wanted to avoid this problem
i wanted to do the right thing
i wanted to say that i'm sorry
i wanted to tell tom something
i was afraid i might be killed
i was almost run over by a car
i was asked to fix the bicycle
i was at tom's place yesterday
i was born and raised in tokyo
i was born during the cold war
i was born with twelve fingers
i was convinced tom was guilty
i was eating some strawberries
i was expecting tom to be here
i was expecting you last night
i was fascinated by her beauty
i was finding it too difficult
i was going to do it yesterday
i was going to do that for tom
i was in boston just last week
i was invited by an old friend
i was invited to dinner by her
i was invited to their wedding
i was just in the neighborhood
i was late because of the rain
i was nearly run over by a car
i was really worried about tom
i was really worried about you
i was scared to try new things
i was tempted to go home early
i was told to wait for a while
i was trying to make you laugh
i was very satisfied with this
i was worried about his health
i wasn't aware tom was married
i wasn't told a thing about it
i watch the news every evening
i watched tom cross the street
i watched a tennis match on tv
i went to disneyland yesterday
i went to bed early that night
i went to that party by myself
i will always be there for you
i will do my best to finish it
i will get the machine running
i will play the guitar for you
i will protect you from danger
i will sit here until he sings
i will teach you to play chess
i will wait for my sister here
i wish i could paint like that
i wish i had a friend like you
i wish i had a house of my own
i wish i had a million dollars
i wish i hadn't gone to boston
i wish i knew what to tell tom
i wish i wasn't always so busy
i wish tom had been here today
i wish tom had never come here
i wish she had come last night
i wish we both weren't so busy
i wish we had more information
i wish we were still in boston
i wish you peace and happiness
i woke up at five this morning
i won't ask any more questions
i won't be busy this afternoon
i won't be in boston next week
i won't be in boston on monday
i won't be in town this sunday
i won't tell anyone i promise
i won't tolerate such language
i wonder how heavy that box is
i wonder if tom is still angry
i wonder if tom is still awake
i wonder if she will marry him
i wonder if this rumor is true
i wonder what tom will tell us
i wonder what tom's problem is
i wonder when tom will do that
i wonder whether we'll be late
i wonder which jacket is tom's
i wonder who taught tom french
i wonder who wrote this letter
i wonder why tom is so nervous
i wonder why tom is so thirsty
i wonder why tom is so worried
i wonder why tom was so afraid
i wonder why tom was surprised
i wonder why tom was suspended
i wonder why is tom doing that
i work every day except sunday
i would be willing to help you
i would certainly vote for tom
i would like something to read
i would like to ask a question
i wouldn't do that without you
i wouldn't know where to begin
i wouldn't let that bother you
i write poetry in my free time
i wrote tom a letter in french
i wrote a letter to my teacher
i wrote her a letter every day
i'd better get back to my desk
i'd do anything to protect tom
i'd go to boston if i were you
i'd like a table by the window
i'd like something to write on
i'd like to ask tom a question
i'd like to ask a favor of you
i'd like to go skiing with tom
i'd like to go skiing with her
i'd like to go to boston again
i'd like to hear that from tom
i'd like to pay by credit card
i'd like to read your new book
i'd like to stay for one night
i'd like to stay here with tom
i'd like to swim in this river
i'd like to take a short break
i'd like to try on these shoes
i'd like to work at a hospital
i'd like you to read this book
i'd never do a thing like that
i'd prefer to sit on the floor
i'd rather not discuss it here
i'd rather stay here in boston
i'd really rather not eat that
i'd visit boston if i were you
i'll be at home in the morning
i'll be happy to work with you
i'll be here when you get back
i'll be hungry when i get home
i'll be in my office till 230

i'll help tom do that tomorrow
i'll keep that book for myself
i'll leave the decision to you
i'll make the room comfortable
i'll meet tom tomorrow at 230
i'll meet you there in an hour
i'll never listen to tom again
i'll pay thirty dollars for it
i'll probably be out all night
i'll raise my hand as a signal
i'll see you a week from today
i'll see you at the restaurant
i'll send you the book by mail
i'll take a glass of champagne
i'll take care of it from here
i'll tell you everything later
i'll tell you what i won't buy
i'll try to follow your advice
i'll wait another five minutes
i'm a friend of tom and mary's
i'm a patient of dr jackson's
i'm a pretty good chess player
i'm afraid i've eaten too much
i'm afraid tom won't let me go
i'm afraid it'll rain tomorrow
i'm at home almost every night
i'm being as clear as i can be
i'm confused what do i do now
i'm convinced tom isn't guilty
i'm currently living in boston
i'm determined to go to boston
i'm excited about this project
i'm expecting a customer today
i'm fed up with tom's behavior
i'm fed up with his long talks
i'm fixing the washing machine
i'm following their every move
i'm getting married in october
i'm getting married next month
i'm getting stronger every day
i'm getting tired of this game
i'm glad you like my apartment
i'm going back to look for tom
i'm going to boston in october
i'm going to bed early tonight
i'm going to buy clothes today
i'm going to call tom tomorrow
i'm going to call you tomorrow
i'm going to check my messages
i'm going to get married again
i'm going to go back to boston
i'm going to go home right now
i'm going to have to work late
i'm going to see what i can do
i'm going to take a bath first
i'm happy nothing bad happened
i'm having some legal problems
i'm here just for the holidays
i'm impressed with your french
i'm invited to a party tonight
i'm just telling you the truth
i'm keeping my fingers crossed
i'm looking for a place to eat
i'm more worried about tom now
i'm never angry without reason
i'm never going to drink again
i'm not allowed to do anything
i'm not always free on sundays
i'm not asking your permission
i'm not certain tom likes that
i'm not exactly happy about it
i'm not going to be very happy
i'm not going to kiss you tom
i'm not going to let you drive
i'm not going to run for mayor
i'm not having dinner with you
i'm not interested in politics
i'm not married to tom anymore
i'm not ready for a change yet
i'm not so sure i want the job
i'm not sure i can contact tom
i'm not sure i know what to do
i'm not sure tom recognized me
i'm not sure tom will be there
i'm not sure there's a problem
i'm not sure this is necessary
i'm not sure where tom will go
i'm not talking about that now
i'm not talking about you tom
i'm not trying to be sarcastic
i'm not worried about anything
i'm not your assistant anymore
i'm only trying to protect you
i'm pretty sure tom likes mary
i'm reading the new york times
i'm reading a fascinating book
i'm ready to go but tom isn't
i'm really not all that hungry
i'm responsible for everything
i'm running linux on my laptop
i'm satisfied with what i have
i'm saving up to buy a new car
i'm sick of all the complaints
i'm slightly worried about tom
i'm sorry that happened to you
i'm sorry to have bothered you
i'm sorry i don't have change
i'm sorry but it's impossible
i'm sorry but my answer is no
i'm sorry that flight is full
i'm sorry this flight is full
i'm sorry this isn't for sale
i'm still too young to do that
i'm still waiting for my order
i'm studying several languages
i'm sure i can find everything
i'm sure tom doesn't want that
i'm sure tom is very impressed
i'm sure tom will be all right
i'm sure tom will be exhausted
i'm sure tom will be here soon
i'm sure tom will be impressed
i'm sure tom won't be arrested
i'm sure tom won't be done yet
i'm sure tom won't be punished
i'm sure tom's mother is proud
i'm sure it wasn't intentional
i'm surprised tom remembers us
i'm surprised at your behavior
i'm taking the train to boston
i'm thankful for your kindness
i'm thinking of buying a house
i'm thinking of writing a book
i'm three years older than you
i'm too lazy to do my homework
i'm used to sleeping in a tent
i'm very much in favor of this
i'm waiting for tom to do that
i'm willing to forget the past
i'm worried about tom's future
i'm worried about tom's health
i'm writing this letter to tom
i've agreed to do that for tom
i've already called the police
i've already washed the dishes
i've always been very discreet
i've always lived in australia
i've always wanted to meet tom
i've always wanted to meet you
i've always wanted to try that
i've been divorced three times
i've been down with a headache
i've been everywhere in europe
i've been here for three weeks
i've been here for three years
i've been here waiting for you
i've decided to move to boston
i've finally got the whole set
i've finished cleaning my room
i've finished reading the book
i've got a previous engagement
i've got one like that already
i've got something in the oven
i've got something to tell you
i've got to do my homework now
i've got to do something first
i've got to give tom something
i've got to show you something
i've got to tell you something
i've had a little bit too much
i've known tom for a long time
i've met tom quite a few times
i've never been good at french
i've never been so embarrassed
i've never forgotten that time
i've never heard of this actor
i've never made a lot of money
i've never mentioned your name
i've never seen such a big dog
i've never seen you so nervous
i've never told this to anyone
i've never won anything before
i've played sports all my life
i've seen tom dance many times
i've seen tom on tv many times
i've stopped worrying about it
i've thought about it recently
if i could explain it i would
if i had money i could buy it
if i knew it i would tell you
if tom can't do it nobody can
if we walk we'll be very late
in my opinion tom is innocent
in other words he betrayed us
in spring the days get longer
insects are attracted to light
iron is a metal with many uses
is boston a good place to live
is french your native language
is tom good at speaking french
is tom in some kind of trouble
is tom really a french teacher
is tom really going to do that
is tom still working in boston
is tom unhappy about something
is everything ok at the office
is he done using the telephone
is it ok for me to come in now
is it ok to come tomorrow too
is it always so awful in april
is it your first day at school
is that what you wanted to buy
is that why you went to boston
is this really happening to me
is this the train for new york
is this too hard to understand
isn't tom forgetting something
isn't it about time to go home
isn't it time for you to leave
isn't that obvious to everyone
isn't that what we anticipated
it all started because of this
it became necessary to do that
it began to rain cats and dogs
it cost thirty million dollars
it could've been any one of us
it depends on how strong it is
it didn't make much difference
it doesn't cost money to smile
it doesn't make a lot of sense
it doesn't make any difference
it doesn't matter what he said
it doesn't rain here very much
it doesn't sound very exciting
it had been snowing for a week
it happened on halloween night
it has nothing to do with luck
it has nothing to do with that
it has nothing to do with this
it is about the size of an egg
it is difficult to talk to him
it is getting warmer every day
it is high time we went to bed
it is necessary to lose weight
it is no good arguing with you
it is no use worrying about it
it is not the correct solution
it is obvious that he is right
it is our duty to obey the law
it is rude to interrupt others
it isn't easy to master french
it isn't going to rain tonight
it looked like tom was worried
it looks like tom is depressed
it looks like tom is desperate
it looks like tom is organized
it looks like tom is skeptical
it looks like tom will succeed
it looks like tom won the race
it looks like it'll rain today
it looks like snow doesn't it
it makes you happy doesn't it
it may look easy but it's not
it seemed that he had been ill
it seems i was wrong about tom
it seems i was wrong about you
it seems tom's in love with me
it snowed in boston last night
it sounded too good to be true
it took a long time to do that
it took many years to build it
it turned out that i was right
it was tom who washed your car
it was a very beautiful flower
it was an unfortunate accident
it was fun playing in the park
it was hard for tom to do that
it was her habit to rise early
it was sort of a weird feeling
it was terribly cold yesterday
it was too great a coincidence
it wasn't very cold last night
it will cost around 10000 yen
it will most likely rain today
it will probably snow tomorrow
it won't be so easy to do that
it would be impolite to refuse
it would be very useful for me
it'll take too long to explain
it's tom that wants to see you
it's tom who should be nervous
it's tom's word against mary's
it's a beautiful day isn't it
it's a nice day to eat outside
it's a pity when somebody dies
it's a polite way of saying no
it's a very big social problem
it's a waste of time and money
it's all going to be all right
it's almost midnight in boston
it's an understandable mistake
it's certainly a waste of time
it's colder than usual tonight
it's even worse than i thought
it's getting colder and colder
it's getting late i should go
it's getting warmer and warmer
it's getting warmer day by day
it's going to all be over soon
it's going to be a long winter
it's going to rain all weekend
it's going to take a long time
it's great to finally be alone
it's hard to resist temptation
it's hard to speak french well
it's healthy to breathe deeply
it's important to have courage
it's just not worth the effort
it's late you have to go home
it's likely that tom will come
it's my turn to pay for dinner
it's nearly midnight in boston
it's not an impossible request
it's not as easy as tom thinks
it's not as simple as all that
it's not easy to master french
it's not going to be a problem
it's not going to be that easy
it's not going to rain tonight
it's nothing worth considering
it's one of my favorite movies
it's one of their better songs
it's popular among the elderly
it's pretty romantic isn't it
it's quite warm here isn't it
it's simpler and more reliable
it's something i've considered
it's something only tom can do
it's still better than nothing
it's still too early to get up
it's supposed to rain tomorrow
it's supposed to snow tomorrow
it's the best job in the world
it's the voice of an old woman
it's time for you to go to bed
it's time to make some changes
it's too hot to work right now
it's too late to apologize now
it's too late to visit tom now
it's unlikely tom will do that
it's unlikely tom will help us
it's very cold here in january
it's very cold today isn't it
it's very difficult to do that
it's very difficult to explain
it's very impressive isn't it
it's very quiet here isn't it
it's where it's supposed to be
japanese cars are very popular
just seeing it made me nervous
kyoto is not as large as osaka
last night i had a weird dream
learning a language takes time
let tom finish what he started
let me help you to do the work
let me tell you about the case
let us never speak of it again
let's begin with that question
let's do the homework together
let's find out what tom thinks
let's find out where tom lives
let's go and swim in the river
let's go straight to the beach
let's go to boston next spring
let's go to a concert together
let's have a moment of silence
let's hope that doesn't happen
let's keep our fingers crossed
let's make it monday afternoon
let's not bother tom with this
let's not worry about that now
let's postpone until next week
let's see what tom can tell us
let's sing the song in english
let's talk about tom's problem
let's talk about what happened
life in a small town is boring
like i said we have a problem
lincoln was opposed to slavery
lions are stronger than wolves
look at the contract carefully
look at the size of that thing
look at those fish in the pond
look at yourself in the mirror
look out there's a car coming
look i don't want any trouble
look tom it's going to be ok
luck has nothing to do with it
madrid is the capital of spain
make the most of your vacation
many of the votes were illegal
many people envy tom's success
mary and i became good friends
mary and tom go to high school
mary gave tom her hand to kiss
mary has beautiful handwriting
mary is a very beautiful woman
mary is interested in politics
mary is really cute isn't she
mary is the woman of my dreams
mary is very pretty isn't she
mary is wearing a yellow dress
mary is your sister isn't she
mary put her piano up for sale
mary stayed up late last night
mary told me that she loved me
mary wants to become a teacher
may i go to the movies tonight
may i leave school early today
may i suggest another approach
may i tell you a little secret
maybe i could help tom do that
maybe tom and mary are in love
maybe tom is just being modest
maybe tom will do that for you
maybe tom will know what to do
maybe tom won't finish on time
maybe someone else can help us
maybe you didn't understand me
maybe you should tell tom that
maybe you'd like to go with us
memorize the poem by next week

no visitors are permitted here
nobody invited me to the party

nobody told tom not to do that
nobody's going to believe that
nobody's going to believe this
nobody's told me what happened
none of that actually happened
none of these books are useful
none of those books are useful
none of us have been to hawaii
none of what tom said was true
nothing can be worse than that
nothing has been confirmed yet
nothing will happen until 230
now he has nothing to live for
now all i need is information
now let's not get discouraged
oh that's kind of interesting
one of my friend's dogs is fat

right now i feel like talking
she accused me of being a liar
she advised him to be punctual
she advised him to lose weight
she advised him to work harder
she also bought the dictionary
she always tries something new
she and her friends love music
she asked him to carry her bag
she asked how to cook the fish
she asked us several questions
she bought a toy for her child
she bought the dictionary too
she called me in the afternoon
she came from canada to see me
she can say whatever she wants
she can't control her emotions
she can't play piano very well
she certainly did not hate him
she couldn't go to the wedding
she cut the apple with a knife
she did her best to rescue him
she earns more than she spends
she explained the matter to me
she fell in love with a prince
she filled her bag with apples
she finished the job with ease

she smokes 20 cigarettes a day
she thanked me for the present
she thought of a good solution
she told him that he was right
she told me to open the window
she tried to hide her feelings
she turned down his invitation
she used to be a very shy girl
she waited for hours and hours
she wanted to become a teacher

she warned him not to go alone
she was afraid to travel alone
she was almost late for school
she was coming down the stairs
she was crying as she answered
she was encouraged by the news
she went out of the restaurant
she went to the museum by taxi

i was a little bit disappointed
i was able to solve the problem
i was afraid of catching a cold

i was born in australia in 2013
i was caught with my pants down
i was having trouble doing that
i was home for a couple of days
i was in boston three weeks ago
i was in boston three years ago
i was in prison for three years
i was just trying to be helpful
i was late for school yesterday
i was never contacted by anyone
i was not aware of his presence
i was only there for three days
i was persuaded to stop smoking
i was promoted three months ago
i was surprised to see you here
i was told tom wanted to see me
i was too scared to do anything
i was too tired to keep working
i was used to eating like a pig
i was watching tv when tom came
i wasn't able to leave my house
i wasn't able to understand tom
i wasn't as strong as my father
i wasn't complaining about that
i wasn't even driving that fast
i wasn't sure where to find you
i wasn't there when it happened
i wasn't trying to kill anybody
i watch television after supper
i watch television all day long
i went out in spite of the rain
i went to europe before the war
i went to high school in boston
i went to the park this morning
i will buy a new car next month
i will buy a watch at the store
i will come weather permitting
i will continue with my efforts
i will finish this work somehow
i will go to new york next week
i will never fall in love again
i will show you around the city
i will show you how to solve it
i will take care of the flowers
i wish i had a voice like tom's
i wish i had known how to do it
i wish i had more close friends
i wish i had told tom the truth
i wish i were as rich as tom is
i wish i'd bought a white dress
i wish tom were here to help us

i won't accept no for an answer
i won't be able to eat all this
i won't be coming back with tom
i won't be in boston next month
i won't let him come here again
i won't say anything about that
i wonder if tom is a vegetarian
i wonder if tom is still skinny
i wonder what i should do today
i wonder what tom meant by that
i wonder what this phrase means
i wonder where tom and mary are
i wonder whether tom is excited
i wonder who helped tom do that
i wonder who's going to help us
i wonder why tom didn't call me
i wonder why tom didn't do that
i worked in my office yesterday
i would also like to rent a car
i would like something to drink
i would like to buy some cheese
i would like to go to sleep now

i'd like to meet tom if i could
i'd like to open a bank account
i'd like to see tom immediately
i'd like to see the doctor soon
i'd like to see what i'm buying
i'd never do anything so stupid
i'd never go to boston with tom
i'd prefer to do that by myself

i'd rather have a piece of cake
i'd suggest you be more careful
i'll be back tomorrow afternoon

i'll tell you the details later
i'll try to do better next time
i'll try to do that before 230
i'll write it on the blackboard
i'm canadian but my wife isn't
i'm a professional photographer
i'm actually having fun tonight
i'm afraid i can't help you now
i'm afraid it may rain tomorrow
i'm afraid that i might be late
i'm afraid that won't be enough
i'm afraid this key doesn't fit
i'm allergic to cigarette smoke
i'm almost as tall as my father
i'm already in a lot of trouble
i'm asking what your opinion is
i'm aware of the risks involved
i'm convinced that you're right
i'm deeply sorry for my actions
i'm doing this as fast as i can
i'm exhausted i'm going to bed
i'm free for breakfast tomorrow
i'm getting married next monday
i'm getting ready for the worst
i'm getting tired of doing that
i'm glad tom isn't here anymore

i'm just trying to be realistic
i'm kind of busy right now tom
i'm learning how to do that now
i'm leaving town for a few days
i'm looking for a job in boston
i'm looking for my mobile phone
i'm no longer afraid of spiders
i'm not a doctor but a teacher
i'm not able to do that anymore
i'm not all that busy right now
i'm not allowed to do that here
i'm not allowed to say anything
i'm not as rich as i used to be
i'm not going anywhere with you
i'm not going to buy this shirt
i'm not going to change my mind
i'm not going to say this twice
i'm not going to school anymore
i'm not going to try doing that
i'm not going to try to do that
i'm not going to waste my money
i'm not going to worry about it
i'm not good at public speaking
i'm not hungry but i'm thirsty
i'm not in that much of a hurry
i'm not rich enough to buy that
i'm not saying it's tom's fault
i'm not smart enough to do that
i'm not sure i want to see this
i'm not sure i'm ready for this
i'm not sure that's a good idea
i'm not telling you to go alone
i'm not working for tom anymore
i'm not working for you anymore
i'm now learning how to do that
i'm only bringing two suitcases
i'm pretty sure tom's ambitious
i'm probably going to try again
i'm rather skeptical about that
i'm rather surprised to hear it
i'm reading an interesting book
i'm ready for my next challenge
i'm ready to face any challenge
i'm really going to miss boston
i'm satisfied with his progress
i'm saving money for my old age
i'm short of cash at the moment
i'm sleepy so i'm going to bed
i'm smart enough not to do that
i'm so sorry that i doubted you
i'm so tired that i can't go on
i'm sorry for the late response
i'm sorry that i went to boston
i'm sorry to have disturbed you
i'm sorry i don't speak french
i'm sorry i forgot my homework
i'm sorry tom has already gone
i'm sorry but i can't help you
i'm sorry but the answer is no
i'm sorry my dad isn't at home
i'm speaking to you as a friend
i'm still determined to do that
i'm still not very good at golf
i'm sure i saw something moving
i'm sure tom was here yesterday
i'm sure tom will agree to help
i'm sure tom will do a good job
i'm sure tom will figure it out
i'm sure tom won't be at mary's
i'm sure tom won't be impressed
i'm sure tom won't be surprised
i'm sure tom won't forgive mary
i'm sure that's what tom wanted
i'm sure we're going to need it
i'm sure you'll find a good job
i'm talking to tom on the phone
i'm the one who found tom's key
i'm thinking of going to boston
i'm tired and want to go to bed
i'm too busy to talk to you now
i'm trying not to waste my time
i'm used to driving on the left
i'm very grateful for your help
i'm very hopeful for the future
i'm very serious about my music
i'm very sure i have to do that
i'm waiting for tom to get back
i'm waiting for tom to get here
i'm waiting for a call from tom
i'm waiting for the right woman
i'm waiting to see if it's true
i'm willing to help tom do that
i'm writing a letter to tom now
i've accepted tom's resignation
i've actually never played golf
i've agreed to teach tom french
i've already finished breakfast
i've already read that document
i've already read today's paper
i've already started doing that
i've already told you the truth
i've always been good at sports
i've always wanted one of these
i've been a teacher a long time
i've been appointed to help you
i've been asked to sing tonight
i've been here for three months
i've been playing a lot of golf
i've been saying the same thing
i've been sent to give you this
i've been to boston three times
i've been trying to wake tom up
i've been unable to contact tom
i've been very patient with you
i've been waiting for two hours
i've decided to keep doing that
i've discovered a serious error
i've done the same thing myself
i've done this a thousand times
i've enjoyed reading this novel
i've explained all this already
i've found tom a french teacher
i've given tom something to eat
i've given you too many chances
i've got a million things to do
i've got a soccer game tomorrow
i've got good news for you tom
i've got nothing to worry about
i've got this all under control
i've had enough of tom and mary
i've never been bitten by a dog
i've never been so proud of tom
i've never ever seen one before
i've never flown in an airplane
i've never played golf with tom
i've never seen tom around here
i've never seen tom help anyone
i've never seen that guy before
i've never seen you here before
i've requested political asylum
i've seen a lot of tom recently
i've seen several of his movies
i've told you everything i know
i've tried everything i know of
i've visited boston three times
i've waited as long as possible
i've written the letter already
if i had time i could help you
if i were you i wouldn't do it
if i were you i wouldn't do so
if i were you i'd buy that one
if he doesn't come we won't go
if it ain't broke don't fix it
if it's tom we've got problems
if only i had taken your advice
if you are free give me a hand
if you want quality pay for it
if you want to talk let's talk
in 2013 tom moved to australia
in england labor day is in may
in any case it's too expensive
in school tom was often teased
in those days he was a student
is tom coming to dinner with us
is tom planning to come with us
is tom really a science teacher
is tom still obliged to do that
is a meal served on this flight
is everybody ready for the trip
is everything all right at home
is it a compliment or an insult
is it difficult to learn french
is it hot enough to go swimming
is it safe to cross this bridge
is it too late to say i'm sorry
is lunch included in this price
is room service still available
is somebody teaching you french
is someone knocking on the door
is something bothering you tom
is tea more expensive than milk
is that specific enough for you
is that what i'm supposed to do
is the chairman going to resign
it began to rain toward evening
it definitely was a possibility
it does not have to be this way
it doesn't have to be like that
it doesn't have to happen again
it doesn't make much difference
it doesn't matter what tom said
it doesn't matter what she said
it doesn't rain here very often
it has to be taken into account
it hasn't always been like this
it is a matter of life or death
it is a pity that he can't come
it is getting darker and darker
it is good to be kind to others
it is not easy to speak english
it is rare for him to get angry
it is said the house is haunted
it is ten minutes before eleven
it is terribly hot this morning
it is this window that he broke
it is time for you to go to bed
it is very cold today isn't it
it is written in simple english
it looks like tom has come back
it looks like tom is by himself
it looks like tom won't do that
it looks like we'd better leave
it may be that he likes his job
it may just be a matter of time
it might be worth investigating
it must be difficult to do that
it obviously wasn't an accident
it rained last night didn't it
it seems that tom won't do that
it shouldn't be too complicated
it snowed from monday to friday
it sounds like we've got a deal
it usually happens very quickly
it was tom who broke the window
it was tom's favorite you know
it was a very complicated world
it was about the size of an egg
it was impolite of him to do so
it was raining hard in new york
it was raining heavily in osaka
it was tough to finish the work
it wasn't even a disappointment
it wasn't in boston that we met
it wasn't much of an earthquake
it would be better to stay home
it'll arrive in chicago at 630
it's tom that i want to talk to
it's a disappointment isn't it
it's a lot harder than it looks
it's a matter of life and death
it's a matter of national pride
it's a matter of personal taste
it's a pity that tom is leaving
it's a pity that you can't come
it's a very difficult situation
it's a waste of time to do that
it's about time to go to school
it's about time you got married
it's against the law to do that
it's almost midnight go to bed
it's always hard to say goodbye
it's been a very difficult year
it's difficult for me to say no
it's easier to die than to love
it's easy to pick up bad habits
it's getting darker outside now
it's going to be christmas soon
it's going to be very difficult
it's going to rain this evening
it's hard for me to talk to tom
it's hard to steal from a thief
it's ideal weather for a picnic
it's important to keep learning
it's interesting to talk to tom
it's just never going to happen
it's likely that she'll succeed
it's no use telling me anything
it's not exactly rocket science
it's not going to be a disaster
it's not like tom to be so late
it's not my problem it's tom's
it's not my problem it's yours
it's not nice to talk like that
it's quite likely tom will come
it's raining cats and dogs here
it's really expensive isn't it
it's time to take your medicine
it's two o'clock in the morning
it's unclear why tom isn't here
it's up to you to make a choice
it's what i've been waiting for
japan is not as large as canada
japan is subject to earthquakes
keep your hands off my daughter
kids are smarter than you think
kids love pasta in tomato sauce
kyoto is japan's former capital
last night i listened to radio
last summer i traveled to italy
later he wrote to the president
laughing is really good for you
laughing really is good for you
let me introduce you to my wife
let me take you to the hospital
let your smile be your umbrella
let's eat pizza for lunch today
let's find a safe place to hide
let's go down the stairs slowly
let's go for a walk after lunch
let's go out before it gets hot
let's go out for dinner tonight
let's go say hi to the jacksons
let's go see if tom can help us
let's go tell tom the good news
let's have a glass of champagne
let's hope it goes well tonight
let's leave the decision to tom
let's not let that happen again
let's not permit tom to do that
let's not talk about it anymore
let's not talk about this today
let's put it off till next week
let's split up and look for tom
let's start after he comes home
let's start as soon as he comes
let's take a break for a second
let's take each day as it comes
let's talk about it over dinner
let's talk about that right now
letters are delivered every day
life was very different for tom
light travels faster than sound
listen and repeat each sentence

mary spent all her time working
mary was tom's first girlfriend
mary was an extraordinary woman
mary was wearing a pretty dress
mary works parttime as a nurse
mary wrapped herself in a towel
mathematics is difficult for me

may i speak to you for a minute
may i speak with you alone tom
maybe i should become a painter
maybe i should talk to a lawyer
maybe tom doesn't need our help
maybe tom isn't crazy after all
maybe tom won't go to australia
maybe tom would like to do that
maybe we should come back later
maybe we should stay right here
maybe we'll be working together
maybe you didn't understand tom
maybe you'd better come with us

i've never hit anyone in my life
i've never known anyone like tom
i've packed my suitcases already
i've spoken to tom and he's fine
i've told you not to call me tom
i've tried doing that many times
i've waited a long time for this
i've waited for more than a week
if i don't protect you who will
if i see tom i'll tell him that
if i were free i could help you
if it doesn't rain let's go out
if it rains tomorrow i won't go
if it smells funny don't eat it
if it were up to me i'd say yes
if you don't work you don't eat
in japan school starts in april
in a sense life is only a dream
in brief the party was splendid
in case of fire push the button
in general things are all right
is tom more intelligent than you
is tom planning to do that today
is tom really going to tell mary
is tom still planning to do that
is tom studying french at school
is eating cockroaches a bad idea
is everything all right in there
is everything ready for tomorrow
is he taller than his brother is
is it ok if i change the channel
is it ok if i turn off the light
is it close enough to walk there
is it on this side of the street
is it too late to change my mind
is it true that tom is in prison
is it true that tom will do that
is it true that you hate parties
is that clear enough for you now
is that the train i have to take
is the meeting today or tomorrow
is this your first time in korea
is your brother a ski instructor
is your brother still in germany
is your husband also from boston
isn't it true that you own a gun
isn't that what tom said to mary
it all depends how you handle it
it appears that he is a musician
it began to rain and she got wet
it cost you a fortune didn't it
it could cause too many problems
it doesn't have to end like that
it doesn't matter what i believe
it doesn't matter what you think
it doesn't surprise you does it
it has been raining since sunday
it has been snowing for two days
it is paris that i want to visit
it is better to act than to talk
it is dangerous to drive so fast
it is expensive to live in japan
it is obvious that that is a lie
it is ten degrees below zero now
it is two o'clock in the morning
it is very kind of you to say so
it isn't illegal to do that here
it looks like tom wants to leave
it looks like it's going to rain
it looks like it's going to snow
it looks like it's working again
it probably wouldn't have helped
it rained hard yesterday morning
it seemed tom and mary were sick
it seems to me that he is honest
it seems to me that you're wrong
it seems we are in the same boat
it should be possible to do that
it sounds incredible doesn't it
it sounds strange but it's true
it was getting louder and louder
it was late when i returned home
it was less than fifteen dollars
it was nothing but a coincidence
it was raining when they arrived
it was shorter than she expected
it was supposed to be a surprise
it was that dog that bit my hand
it was the best night of my life
it was very cold but i went out
it wasn't because tom didn't try
it wasn't easy for me to do that
it wasn't supposed to happen yet
it will be hard to find the time
it will stop raining before long
it won't be the same without you
it won't take me long to do that
it would be nice to have a party
it would be safer to go by train
it would only be a waste of time
it would probably be a good idea
it'll be easy for tom to do that
it'll cost around thirty dollars
it'll cost at least five dollars
it'll stop snowing soon i think
it's a good thing tom isn't here
it's a lot easier than i thought
it's a pleasure to see you again
it's a question of life or death
it's a risk i'm prepared to take
it's a steal at twice that price
it's already time to go to sleep
it's been ages since we last met
it's dangerous to go there alone
it's easier than you might think
it's evident that you told a lie
it's fairly difficult to do that
it's going to be cloudy tomorrow
it's going to be easy to do that
it's going to start raining soon
it's impolite to stare at people
it's like being in a candy store
it's likely to snow this evening
it's my responsibility isn't it
it's natural for you to think so
it's never too late to turn back
it's no use trying to fix it now
it's not going to be easy for me
it's not something anyone can do
it's not that i'm not interested
it's obvious that you told a lie
it's only a question of time now
it's only going to get worse now
it's probably just a coincidence
it's too dark to play tennis now
it's too late to contact tom now
it's very kind of you to help me
it's very nice of you to help me
it's worth three hundred dollars
it's your duty to finish the job
last night i wrote three letters
leave the documents in my office
let me finish eating my sandwich
let me help you put on your coat
let me in i have to talk to you
let me know if you need any help
let me tell you what i did today
let's contribute to this project
let's discuss that problem later
let's do what tom wants us to do
let's go before i change my mind
let's go to boston and visit tom
let's invite tom over for dinner
let's leave before tom gets here
let's not eat at that restaurant
let's not get ahead of ourselves
let's not talk about money okay
let's not talk about my problems
let's play tennis this afternoon
let's pretend this didn't happen
let's put our cards on the table
let's see what we can do to help
let's spend all weekend together
let's talk about it after school
let's wait and see what tom does
let's wait for another 5 minutes
life is full of confusing things
life was a lot simpler back then
living on a small income is hard
look at the blackboard everyone
look out there's a truck coming
look there's a plane taking off
make sure nothing happens to tom
many americans did not have jobs
many americans welcomed the plan
many birds fly south in the fall
many of my friends are canadians
many people are against the bill
many women are afraid of spiders
mary and alice look like sisters
mary and alice were like sisters
mary and i are in the same class
mary and tom value their privacy
mary asked her family for a loan
mary hasn't painted her room yet
mary is a pretty girl isn't she
mary is a very intelligent woman
mary is exceptionally attractive
mary is much prettier than alice
mary is now studying in her room
mary is prettier than her sister
mary is the perfect girl for tom
mary is the perfect girl for you
mary is the richest woman i know
mary looks good in a black dress
mary often wears too much makeup
mary said she wanted to marry me
mary showed tom her wedding ring
mary sounds just like her mother
mary thinks i'm in love with her
mary threw me out of the kitchen
mary will get her degree in june
may i have a moment of your time
may i have another piece of cake
may i introduce my friend to you
maybe i shouldn't have done that
maybe tom can solve this problem
maybe tom is too busy to help us
maybe tom spoke french with mary
maybe it won't make a difference
maybe you should call the police
men fear what they can't control
most of the dogs are still alive
most people don't like hospitals
mother has not cooked dinner yet
mother is cooking in the kitchen
motivation is the key to success
mt fuji isn't visible from here
my apartment isn't far from here
my aunt brought up five children
my bedroom is smaller than tom's
my best friend comes from canada
my boss made me work last sunday
my brother almost drove me crazy
my brother and i shared the room
my brother and i were very close
my brother paid double the price
my computer doesn't work anymore
my dad is stronger than your dad
my explanation may sound strange
my eyesight is beginning to fail
my family comes before my career
my father bought this hat for me
my father died before i was born
my father doesn't waste his time
my father is very strict with me
my father won't be busy tomorrow
my father would like to meet you
my father's car is made in italy

my son likes books about animals
my teacher has a very soft voice
my uncle is very fond of fishing
my watch is different from yours
my watch loses two minutes a day
my wife doesn't get up before me
neither tom nor mary has a fever
never forget to put out the fire
new york is proud of its museums
new zealand is pretty incredible
next time review more carefully
no matter where i go i get lost
no one called my attention to it
no one comes to visit me anymore
no one has ever done this before
no one knows his address but tom
no one listens to me when i talk
no one thinks that you're stupid
no one was as disappointed as me
nobody cares what happens to tom
nobody knows tom like i know tom
nobody questioned tom's decision
nobody's accusing you of a crime
nobody's taking a bath right now
none of the children are sitting
none of these things surprise me
none of this is really happening
not everyone is happy about this
not everything tom said was true
nothing ever happens around here
nothing's going to happen to you
obviously tom isn't mary's type
of course tom missed his father
oh no we're running out of gas
one of the girls was left behind
one of those people might be tom
only you can answer the question
open the door and let in the dog
open the door and let the dog in
our baseball team is very strong
our cow doesn't give us any milk
our opinions are quite different
our plane is thirty minutes late
our refrigerator is out of order
our school is larger than theirs
our son has just started walking

over time things only got worse
peel the apple before you eat it
people are friendly in australia

people thought that she was dead
people will soon learn the truth
please don't leave the door open
please excuse my bad handwriting
please let me know what you want
please tell tom to do that later
please tell me which one to take
please tell us about your family

she accompanied him on the piano
she acted as if she knew nothing
she advised him to stop drinking
she advised him to use a bicycle
she always speaks in a low voice
she and i have nothing in common
she appears to have many friends
she asked him to open the window
she became a true friend of mine
she began to cry in a loud voice
she began to like him right away
she believes that he is innocent
she can play the piano very well
she can speak english of course
she can't have done such a thing
she cried as she read the letter
she did her best to persuade him
she didn't mind doing the dishes

she made the boy into a fine man
she picked flowers in the garden

she talks a lot about her father
she tends to speak ill of others
she told me an interesting story

she was wondering the same thing
she went to italy to study music

sooner or later she will appear
sorry i wasn't paying attention
sorry you have the wrong number
stamps aren't sold in this store
stars began to appear in the sky
such problems are to be expected
such things have happened before
suddenly all the lights went out
suddenly he changed the subject
switzerland is a neutral country
take as many cookies as you want
take this medicine between meals
talking during a concert is rude
tell tom i'd like to talk to him
tell tom it was nothing personal
tell her that i am taking a bath
tell me how to solve the problem
tell me something about yourself
tell me why you want to go there
ten years is a long time to wait

thank you for the wonderful gift
thank you for your understanding
thank you so much for being here
thanks a lot for the information
thanks to you the job went well
that bridge is anything but safe
that child has a very large head
that could be a problem i think
that day will go down in history

that doesn't mean anything to me
that doesn't sound too difficult
that doesn't sound very exciting
that doesn't sound very romantic
that flower has a powerful smell
that has nothing to do with this
that hat is very much in fashion
that is a very interesting story
that is the house where he lives
that job is pretty much finished

that was completely unacceptable
that was the best day of my life
that was very funny do it again
that was what i was going to say
that wasn't something i expected
that wasn't the end of the story
that wouldn't have happened here
that'll cost three hundred bucks
that's a beautiful piece of meat
that's a fairly reasonable price
that's a hard question to answer
that's a nice tie you're wearing
that's a pretty strong statement
that's a question i can't answer
that's a truly interesting story
that's a very interesting theory
that's actually really dangerous
that's all i'm going to give you
that's an interesting suggestion
that's going to happen very soon
that's highly unlikely to happen
that's just the way she likes it
that's not what i should've done
that's one of my favorite movies
that's only a temporary solution
that's surely a misunderstanding
that's the most important reason
that's the same mistake tom made
that's what tom keeps telling me
that's what makes you so special
that's what the government wants
that's what you've always wanted
that's where i think tom will be

i'm afraid we don't have the time
i'm an old friend of tom's father

i'm meeting tom's parents tonight
i'm not able to do any other work
i'm not always at home on sundays
i'm not free to go this afternoon
i'm not going to be here tomorrow
i'm not going to complain anymore
i'm not normally a jealous person
i'm not sure that i feel the same
i'm not sure you'll have the time
i'm not used to talking in public
i'm not used to this kind of cold
i'm not willing to take that risk
i'm not worried about the meeting
i'm pretty sure tom has done that
i'm sorry i'm calling you at work
i'm sorry for having deceived you
i'm sorry but i don't understand
i'm sorry but where are the eggs
i'm still learning how to do that
i'm still not very good at french
i'm still planning not to do that
i'm still waiting for your answer
i'm suffering from a broken heart
i'm sure tom is very proud of you
i'm sure tom will change his mind
i'm sure tom will enjoy the party
i'm sure tom won't be embarrassed
i'm sure tom wouldn't lie to mary
i'm sure they're talking about us
i'm taking tomorrow afternoon off
i'm terribly sorry for being late
i'm the black sheep of the family
i'm tired of all your complaining
i'm tired of hearing your excuses
i'm too tired to help you do that
i'm too tired to walk any further
i'm very happy that that happened
i'm very interested in doing that
i'm very interested in folk music
i'm very sorry that i lied to tom
i'm waiting for a letter from tom
i've already asked tom to do that
i've already considered that plan
i've already finished my homework
i've always admired your patience
i've always liked this restaurant
i've always wanted to be a father
i've always wanted to be a mother
i've always wanted to be a singer
i've been a teacher for two years
i've been in boston since october
i've been looking for you all day
i've been married for three years
i've been there a couple of times
i've climbed mt fuji three times
i've come all the way from boston
i've complained to tom about that
i've decided to continue studying
i've decided to do that by myself
i've decided to go to the theater
i've done everything you've asked
i've done many interesting things
i've done what tom asked me to do
i've got everything under control
i've got some information for tom
i've got things under control now
i've got to go to church tomorrow
i've had enough of your questions
i've heard no complaints from tom
i've just started learning french
i've just started studying french
i've just written a letter to tom
i've kept a diary for three years
i've lived here since i was a boy
i've locked myself out of my room
i've made some terrible decisions
i've never felt better in my life
i've never had a traffic accident
i've never heard tom speak french
i've never seen this sort of bird
i've never studied french grammar
i've never taught anyone anything
i've tried doing that three times
i've wanted to do this for months
i as an american admire lincoln
ice cream was tom's favorite food
if tom asks me to do that i will
if tom's not happy i'm not happy
if it rains tomorrow we won't go
if it stops raining i'll do that
if something goes wrong call tom
if you ask me tom is the problem
if you don't hurry we'll be late
if you don't want it i'll eat it
in japan people drive on the left
in any case it's always my fault
in my opinion we should hire tom
is french pronunciation difficult
is coffee more expensive than tea
is it ok if we change the subject
is it all right if i call you tom
is it correct to say it like this
is it true that you came by plane
is this the car tom told us about
is this the right train for tokyo
is this what you wanted me to buy
is your school far from your home
isn't that the golden gate bridge
isn't that what you would've done
it cost less than fifteen dollars
it could just be your imagination
it doesn't matter how old you are
it doesn't matter how small it is
it doesn't rain a lot around here
it happened between eight and ten
it has been raining since tuesday
it is a great pleasure to be here
it is a lot of fun to drive a car
it is a very difficult job for us
it is better to give than to take
it is dangerous to drink too much
it is easy to answer the question
it is getting dark let's go home
it is impossible for you to do so
it is not always cold in hokkaido
it is too expensive for me to buy
it is used by a great many people
it is very kind of you to help me
it isn't too difficult to do that
it isn't too hard to learn french
it looks as if it's going to rain
it looks like tom is going to cry
it looks like tom is going to win
it made tom's family really happy
it makes no difference who i meet
it must've been difficult for tom
it rains a lot here in the spring
it really isn't worth the trouble
it seemed like a good opportunity
it seems like tom is here to stay
it seems that he is telling a lie
it seems that the diamond is real
it seems that you know the answer
it sounds like tom is the problem
it takes a thief to catch a thief
it was july the heat was intense
it was tom who asked the question
it was a great time for hollywood
it was a waste of time and effort
it was almost noon when i woke up
it was hard to make this decision
it was not long before he arrived
it wasn't exactly a piece of cake
it will begin snowing before long
it will clear up in the afternoon
it's tom you should be angry with
it's tom's turn to deal the cards
it's a disaster waiting to happen
it's a good thing i came prepared
it's a magnificent view isn't it
it's a perfect day for a barbecue
it's a wonder they're still awake
it's actually kind of interesting
it's almost impossible to imagine
it's already ten o'clock at night
it's always a pleasure to see you
it's always better to be prepared
it's been ten years since he died
it's cold in boston in the winter
it's difficult but not impossible
it's easy to answer your question
it's hard to handle crying babies
it's my turn to tell you a secret
it's not tom's problem it's mine
it's not hard to make new friends
it's not possible to live forever
it's not the end of the story yet
it's not too difficult to do that
it's possible that tom won't come
it's prohibited in most countries
it's still snowing pretty heavily
it's strange that nobody knows us
it's the most logical explanation
it's the only logical explanation
it's time to take out the garbage
it's two o'clock in the afternoon
it's unlikely but not impossible
it's what we've always dreamed of
it's your turn to wash the dishes
japan knew it was winning the war
keep an eye on my bag for a while
keep it in mind for the next time
kobe is the city where i was born

let's just all go talk to tom ok
let's just say i wasn't surprised
let's meet the day after tomorrow
let's play baseball with everyone
let's pretend that we're soldiers
let's pretend we didn't hear that
let's solve this problem together
let's start with something simple
let's talk about that over drinks
let's throw all these things away
let's wait until it stops raining
listening to music is lots of fun

many kinds of birds live in japan
many people went to tom's funeral

mary was my first real girlfriend
may i ask you a personal question
may i ask you some more questions
may i come see you this afternoon
may i have something hot to drink
may i have your attention please
maybe tom didn't like what he saw
maybe tom doesn't know where i am
maybe tom should go to the doctor
maybe it's best not to add pepper
maybe this only happens in boston
maybe we can do something to help
maybe we should go back to boston
men and women do that differently
men are better at this than women
men make houses women make homes
men talk about women all the time

i thought it was an exciting story
i thought that i'd lost everything
i thought that tom had gotten lost
i thought that tom was embarrassed

i thought we could make it by 230
i thought we were on the same side
i thought you already had a ticket

i wanted tom to drive me to school
i wanted to know what would happen
i wanted to make a few phone calls
i wanted to retire three years ago
i was able to play piano very well
i was afraid the fire might go out
i was almost afraid to talk to you
i was at home until noon yesterday
i was beginning to worry about you
i was born and brought up in tokyo
i was foolish enough to believe it
i was fortunate to find a good job
i was given this watch by my uncle
i was going to call tom back today
i was having a hard time breathing
i was having trouble concentrating
i was in boston when that happened
i was just going to write a letter
i was stupid enough to believe tom
i was thinking about getting a dog
i was thinking about what tom said
i was tired but continued working
i was unable to finish my homework
i was waiting for the right moment
i was young and i needed the money
i wasn't enjoying myself very much
i wasn't expecting tom to be there
i wasn't in my office this morning
i wasn't surprised by the question
i wear sunglasses almost every day
i went to bed last night at eleven
i will always be there to help you
i will be working all day tomorrow

i won't be in time for the meeting
i won't bother you anymore tonight
i won't have time to do that today
i won't let anything happen to tom
i won't need to cancel my vacation
i wonder if tom is still depressed
i wonder if tom is still skeptical
i wonder if tom likes chinese food
i wonder if tom refused to do that
i wonder if tom still remembers me
i wonder if tom will be here today
i wonder if something has happened
i wonder what's taking tom so long
i wonder where tom bought that hat
i wonder whether i should warn tom
i wonder whether tom is happy here
i wonder which one of you is lying
i wondered why tom wasn't drinking
i worked in boston for three years
i would like to learn how to dance
i would never question his honesty
i wouldn't know what to say to tom
i wouldn't like to be in her shoes
i write letters which i never send
i'd be taking a loss at that price

i'm getting a lot better at tennis
i'm glad that the rain has stopped
i'm glad we put all that behind us
i'm going to bring tom some dinner
i'm going to get there before dark
i'm going to show tom how to do it
i'm happy with the way things went
i'm having dinner with tom tonight
i'm helping tom out with something
i'm here because i have to be here

i'm not interested in your opinion
i'm not looking for a relationship
i'm not naive i'm just optimistic
i'm not planning to work on monday
i'm not satisfied with the results
i'm not saying i'm better than tom
i'm not sure tom wants to go there
i'm not sure if that's a good idea
i'm not that good at writing songs
i'm pretty sure tom is dating mary
i'm probably not as busy as tom is
i'm reading a book about languages
i'm scared tom is going to kill me
i'm sorry i didn't keep my promise
i'm sorry i made you cry yesterday
i'm sorry that tom thinks that way
i'm sorry to have kept you waiting
i'm sorry but i really have to go
i'm sorry my mother's not at home

i'm starting to feel sorry for tom
i'm still interested in doing that
i'm still studying french with tom

i'm still waiting for it to happen
i'm still waiting to hear from tom
i'm studying french and web design
i'm sure i'll win the tennis match
i'm sure tom has a lot to tell you
i'm sure tom knows what he's doing
i'm sure tom wants to live with us
i'm sure tom won't want to do that
i'm sure everything will be ok now
i'm sure you'll think of something
i'm surprised tom isn't busy today
i'm surprised tom isn't happy here
i'm surprised they let tom in here
i'm the one who ought to apologize
i'm the one who pays all the bills
i'm the one who stole the painting
i'm the youngest of three children
i'm thinking about going on a trip
i'm thinking of opening up a store
i'm three years older than you are
i'm trying to figure out something
i'm unable to answer that question
i'm very sorry i came home so late
i'm very sorry about what happened
i'm worried that tom will get lost
i've already discussed it with tom
i've already saved your life twice
i've already told tom how to do it
i've already told tom what you did
i've already told this to the cops
i've always been afraid of doctors
i've always played with my brother
i've always wanted to go to boston
i've always wanted to study french
i've always wanted to visit boston
i've answered this question before
i've been a teacher for five years
i've been drinking a lot of coffee
i've been drinking too much coffee
i've been in this situation before
i've been making decisions all day
i've been to australia three times
i've been to boston more than once
i've been told i shouldn't do that
i've decided not to live in boston
i've decided to end our friendship
i've done everything i can to help
i've done nothing to be ashamed of
i've finished watering the flowers
i've got a lot of work to do today
i've got to get back to the office
i've got to go to boston next week
i've got two brothers and a sister
i've just been to my uncle's house
i've just heard a disturbing rumor
i've locked myself out of my house
i've locked myself out of the room
i've made many mistakes in my life
i've never been happier in my life
i've never borrowed money from tom
i've never done anything impulsive
i've never had this problem before
i've never seen this design before
i've never told anyone this before
i've promised tom that i'd do that
i've read every book on this shelf
i've still got a lot of work to do
i've taught french for three years
i too didn't understand anything
if i do that tom will laugh at me
if i don't do it now i never will
if i had money i'd buy a computer
if i had wings i would fly to you
if i were you i wouldn't eat that
if the car breaks down we'll walk
if you are here it means you care
if you do that tom will get angry
if you don't want it don't eat it
if you eat that tom will be angry
if you have a problem talk to tom
if you refuse tom will be furious
imagine yourself to be on the moon
in case of fire break this window
in case of fire press this button
in the evening i walk with my dog
is tom eating an apple or a banana
is tom still determined to do that
is it really that important to you
is it something you can get rid of
is it that difficult to understand
is it true tom is moving to boston
is it true that tom is never wrong
is it true that tom killed himself
is it true you're moving to boston
is this a good time to buy a house
is this the one you're looking for
isn't that what you think happened
it began to rain before i got home
it feels like the end of the world
it is certain that he will succeed
it is difficult to give up smoking
it is easy to answer this question
it is especially cold this morning
it isn't as difficult as it sounds
it isn't as difficult as you think
it isn't difficult to speak french
it isn't easy to solve the problem
it isn't easy to speak french well
it isn't polite to stare at people
it looks like i got here too early
it looks like tom bought a new car
it looks like tom is getting tired
it looks like you just saw a ghost
it matters little where he is from
it might not just be a coincidence
it ought to be possible to do that
it seems that everybody likes golf
it seems to me that he likes music
it seems to me that you are honest
it was tom that asked the question
it was a friend of mine who called
it was a great victory for jackson
it was a perfect day for the beach
it was a pleasure working with you
it was a very traditional ceremony
it was his bicycle that was stolen
it was his first trip as a captain
it was very cold yesterday morning
it'll be very difficult to explain
it'll stop snowing sooner or later
it'll take us hours to finish this
it's tom's first time in australia
it's a difficult word to pronounce
it's a difficult word to translate
it's a matter of national security
it's a popular tourist destination
it's a ridiculous question really
it's a story based on a real event
it's about time you went to school
it's been raining since last night
it's dangerous to cross the bridge
it's down that street on the left
it's illegal to park your car here
it's just like walking on the moon
it's more dangerous than i thought
it's more difficult than you think
it's more than a hundred years old
it's my turn to take out the trash
it's no secret that i hate ironing
it's no use crying over spilt milk
it's no use trying to convince tom
it's no use trying to persuade her
it's not difficult to speak french
it's not much of a surprise is it
it's not polite to point at others
it's not safe at night around here
it's not worth reading any further
it's obvious tom doesn't like mary
it's obvious why his stomach hurts
it's rude to talk during a concert
it's said that he knows the secret
it's something really embarrassing
it's the only possible explanation
it's time to tell people the truth
it's too dark to play baseball now
it's your turn to tell me a secret
jackson agreed to be at the dinner
john met mary on his way to school
kyoto and boston are sister cities
land prices are very high in japan
last night we went to the theater
last summer we went to disneyland
learning a foreign language is fun
leave more space between the lines
let me have a little chat with tom
let me introduce my parents to you
let's ask tom if he paid his taxes
let's eat now i'm dying of hunger
let's find out what else tom wants
let's meet in front of the library
let's meet in front of the station
let's play basketball after school
let's pretend we're happy together
let's see what's happening outside
let's take the children to the zoo
let's try to make our world better
let's try to speed things up okay
let's wait here till he comes back
life is often compared to a voyage
life means nothing without friends
life's too short to drink bad wine
like his father he has many books
listening to music is a lot of fun
long skirts are out of fashion now
mahjong is a game four people play
many birds fly south in the autumn
many homeless people live in parks
many museums are closed on mondays
many of the workers died of hunger
many paintings hang in art museums
many people attended tom's funeral
many squirrels live in this forest
mary came up to me when she saw me
mary checked herself in the mirror
mary has danced since she was five
mary isn't as active as her sister
mary isn't as pretty as her sister
mary really takes after her mother
mary told me that she was pregnant
mary wanted tom to carry her books
mary was elected queen of the prom
mary was wearing a tight red dress
mathematics is a difficult subject
mathematics is my favorite subject
may i have a glass of beer please
may i have a glass of milk please
may i have a glass of wine please
may i have an advance on my salary
may i take a shower in the morning
may i write on this sheet of paper
maybe i shouldn't be so suspicious
maybe tom can do something to help
maybe tom would be willing to help
maybe they know something we don't
maybe we should sit somewhere else
maybe we should've listened to tom
millions of people lost their jobs
money cannot make up for lost time
mr jackson is my favorite teacher
my french teacher isn't a canadian
my aunt goes to germany every year
my aunt sent me a birthday present
my brother damaged my new computer
my brother depends on me for money
my brother gave me a pair of jeans
my brother has a gift for painting
my brothers and i all share a room
my computer won't start up anymore
my email address has been changed
my family goes to italy every year
my father doesn't really talk much
my father got home late last night
my father is the tallest of us all
my father told me about this place
my feet are smaller than your feet
my grandfather died five years ago

i've got to get tom ready for school
i've got to take an umbrella with me
i've just come back from a long trip
i've just finished reading that book
i've made up my mind to leave boston
i've never been to such a nice party
i've never eaten chinese food before
i've played golf with tom many times
i've seen that movie but tom hasn't
i've spent most of my life in boston

if i were a bird i would fly to you
if i were you i'd follow his advice
if it rains tomorrow tom won't come

you must not discuss this with anyone
you must pay attention to the teacher
you need to take your mother's advice
you never know what's going to happen

i'm having a hard time explaining this
i'm hoping that tom will be here today
i'm hoping they'll give me a big raise
i'm hungry because i haven't had lunch
i'm looking forward to seeing you soon
i'm not accustomed to getting up early
i'm not going to go in there by myself
i'm not going to go to boston with you
i'm not good at doing that but tom is
i'm not sure i want tom working for us
i'm not sure what tom is talking about
i'm not trying to make you feel guilty
i'm not used to this kind of hard work
i'm not very good at writing in french
i'm pretty sure that tom likes his job
i'm sorry but i have to go to the gym
i'm still reluctant to do that for tom
i'm sure i can overcome any difficulty
i'm sure you have a lot to think about
i'm too tired to do anything right now
i'm used to making difficult decisions
i'm very anxious about my son's safety
i'm waiting for tom to help me do that
i'm wearing a sweater because i'm cold
i'm well aware of the problems we face
i've almost finished what i have to do
i've already finished what i had to do
i've already started reading that book
i've always been interested in science
i've always wanted to own a sports car
i've asked tom to come over for dinner
i've been having strange dreams lately
i've been writing letters all day long
i've done many things i shouldn't have
i've got an important message from tom
i've got much work to do at the moment
i've got no more than five hundred yen
i've got some business to take care of
i've got three days off work next week
i've got to go back to boston tomorrow
i've gotten used to going to bed early
i've never fallen in love with anybody

i've never seen this place so deserted
i too will come in about ten minutes

if you could come i'd be really happy
if you eat too much you'll become fat
if you want to be happy then be happy
if you want to know the truth ask tom
in my opinion soccer is a great sport
in other words she became a good wife
in the morning there was a heavy rain
in the sight of god all men are equal
is french taught in elementary schools
is tom really planning on helping mary
is tom's condition really that serious
is it true that tom can't speak french
is it true that tom moved to australia
is it true that tom's father is famous
is it true that you are going to paris
is it true that you can't speak french
is there no alternative to your method
is your father taller than your mother
it appears that i was wrong about that
it can't be measured in terms of money
it could possibly become a big problem
it doesn't look like tom is very happy
it doesn't matter which side you're on
it had snowed heavily the night before
it has been snowing since this morning
it is dangerous to climb that mountain
it is easy for me to solve the problem
it is important for him to get the job
it is important that we make an effort
it is not death that i fear but dying
it is time to stop watching television

it looks like i made a lot of mistakes
it may be that he will never be famous
it seems that he took me for my sister

it was a fine day so we went swimming
it was careless of you to lose the key
it was wise of her to leave home early
it will not be long before he turns up
it's a lot of fun skiing in fresh snow
it's a miracle that tom is still alive
it's a risk we're all prepared to take
it's been a pleasure chatting with you
it's dangerous to play around the fire
it's difficult to answer this question
it's fun to go for a walk in the woods
it's good that the horse didn't suffer
it's hard for me to explain my actions
it's hard to figure out what tom wants
it's important for us to remember that
it's important to care for one another
it's impossible to predict earthquakes
it's kind of late we should get going
it's nearly noon and he's still in bed
it's not an easy subject to talk about
it's obvious tom doesn't know anything
it's painful to keep sitting for hours
it's pretty clear what's going on here
it's quite clear that tom will be late
it's still too cold to go to the beach
it's the best book that i've ever read
it's very important to get enough rest
it's very likely going to be dangerous
japan is not rich in natural resources
japan is not what it was ten years ago
land prices seem to just keep going up
let's give them a little bit of advice

let's hope tom doesn't notice anything
let's see if we can cancel the meeting
let's see if we can solve that mystery
lie down and make yourself comfortable
life is more interesting than any book
like tom said this is a waste of time

i know tom is a good husband and father
i know it won't be difficult to do that

i wasn't able to make myself understood
i wasn't allowed to talk at the meeting

i wish i could go to the party with you
i wish i had more time to talk with her
i wish i hadn't gone to boston with tom
i won't go back to boston until october
i won't wake up even if the alarm rings
i wonder if it really was a coincidence
i wonder where your brother has gone to
i wonder whether tom is homesick or not
i wonder whether or not tom is homesick
i wonder why tom wasn't at school today
i wonder why it's so crowded here today
i worked three years as tom's assistant
i would help you if you were in trouble
i would like to book a flight to brazil
i would rather quit than work under him
i would've done the same thing i think
i wouldn't have dyed my hair that color

i'm trying to find out where it happened
i'm walking in the park with my children
i've already considered that possibility
i've been on a diet for more than a year
i've been working since six this morning
i've considered that possibility as well
i've decided to go to australia with tom
i've finally finished writing the report
i've never been out with a canadian girl
i've never been so humiliated in my life
i've never gone out with a canadian girl
i've never heard of such a strange story
i've never seen anything quite like this
i've never smoked a cigarette in my life
i've written a couple of christmas songs
if i had time i'd accept his invitation
if he's fluent in english i'll hire him
if it rains tomorrow we'll stay at home
if it rains the game will be called off
if possible i would like to go home now
if the ceiling fell he would be crushed
if you go fishing tomorrow i'll go too

i wonder if tom is going to boston next week
i wonder if a third world war will break out
i wonder if you have something to write with

you are really full of curiosity aren't you
you can't possibly really think tom is happy
you didn't come to school yesterday did you
you don't need to worry about that happening
you have friends who can help you don't you
you have only one chance to answer correctly
you have to do that today before you go home
you know that that isn't possible don't you
you know that that's not possible don't you
you may go out as long as you come back soon
you must not take advantage of her innocence
you must put an end to this foolish behavior
you really need to be there tomorrow at 230
you should be more thoughtful of your safety
you should not feel superior to other people
you should try to figure it out for yourself
you shouldn't ride a bicycle on the sidewalk
you shouldn't speak to your parents that way
you shouldn't tell children things like that
you still owe me about three hundred dollars
you want to go to boston with tom don't you
you will soon get used to speaking in public
you won't believe how popular tom has become
you'll have to get up early tomorrow morning
you're mistaken he plays bass not trombone
your english is too good to be in this class
your success is the result of your hard work
a great man doesn't care about his appearance
a telephone is something you can't do without
all he wanted was time to finish his painting
all of three of tom's daughters are beautiful
all the women thought tom was really handsome
apparently tom has been cheating on his wife
are you going to come back to italy next year
as soon as we sat down she brought us coffee
as time goes on my life gets worse and worse
ask me anything you want to know about boston
avoid crossing this street when it is raining
avoid drinking too much water with your meals
because it was summer vacation i took a trip
because of the typhoon the school was closed
cheese and butter are products made from milk
children don't always listen to their parents
country roads aren't as crowded as city roads
dear santa i want a girlfriend for christmas
did you take part in the discussion yesterday
did you tell tom why you want to go to boston
dinner will be ready in about fifteen minutes
do i look like a guy who wants to get married
do you have a problem with what was suggested
do you know any canadians living in australia
do you know what time that supermarket closes
do you realize how much trouble you've caused
do you really believe tom is going to do that
do you think i'm too old to have another baby

do you think we'll have good weather tomorrow
do you think you're smarter than your parents
do you want to do something together sometime
do you want to go grab a hot dog or something
do you want to talk about what happened today
does tom still come to boston every christmas
dogs that bark a lot usually aren't dangerous
don't throw them away you'll need them later
dozens of cars were parked in the parking lot
eventually his rights had to be acknowledged
every time i see tom he's wearing sunglasses
everyone except tom and mary are already here
everything that could go wrong has gone wrong
few people noticed her absence from the party
find tom and tell him to come here right away
for a moment there i thought he had gone mad
forget it there's no sense giving him advice
french is definitely not a difficult language
give the television remote control back to me
going out in this rain is out of the question
having a slight headache i went to bed early
having done my homework i watched television
he became a singer against his parents wishes
he broke his promise which was a big mistake
he can't possibly write the letter by himself
he cared for his mother after his father died
he didn't know what to do with the extra food
he found a public telephone and called a taxi
he gave me not just advice but money as well
he got lost while he was walking in the woods
he has been playing tennis since this morning
he is always complaining about his low salary
he is fighting with his back against the wall
he is not always in the office in the morning
he is one of the most famous singers in japan
he left japan on the same day that we arrived
he listened to the music with his eyes closed
he lives within a stone's throw of the school
he made it clear that he didn't like the food
he made up his mind to keep a diary every day
he said the united states would not interfere
he thought someone had put poison in his soup
he will learn the facts in the course of time
he's been looking for the missing cat all day
he's been taught to accept things as they are
he's the type who doesn't worry about details
her new husband turned out to be a bad person
his aunt takes care of his dog during the day
his condition will soon change for the better
his hands had turned blue because of the cold
his relatives were convinced of his innocence
how can you avoid the dangers of the internet
how long did it take you to write this report
how often do you read books written in french
humans aren't the only animals that use tools
i always have to wear a tie because of my job

i don't think that tom wanted mary to do that
i don't think things will change anytime soon
i don't understand the meaning of this phrase
i don't understand what you are trying to say
i don't want there to be any misunderstanding
i feed my cat every morning and every evening
i give you five minutes to solve this problem
i had a long conversation with tom about that
i had to come to terms with my present salary
i had to walk there because my car broke down
i happened across an old friend in the street
i have a feeling you'll be a very good lawyer
i have a lot of baggage so i can't walk home
i have other things to worry about like work
i have read many of his novels in translation
i have to do my homework instead of going out
i have to go to the airport to meet my cousin
i have to lose weight so i'm going on a diet
i have two dogs three cats and six chickens
i heard that tom wants to swim this afternoon
i know that tom is a person that we can trust
i know that tom is still motivated to do that
i know the photographer who took this picture
i know you've got more important things to do
i learned the hard way that crime doesn't pay
i like the mountains more than i like the sea
i like the red dress more than the blue dress
i need to look that word up in the dictionary

i prefer reading books to watching television
i replied that i didn't have parents any more
i spend too much time in front of my computer
i spent the whole week working on that report
i suspect tom and mary have to leave tomorrow
i talked with him about it over the telephone
i think tom is too young to really be in love
i think about you every time i brush my teeth
i think it's time for me to turn on the radio
i think that maybe tom and i could be friends
i thought that tom was still living in boston
i thought you said you were glad you did that
i thought you wanted to learn to speak french
i threw away all the letters that tom sent me
i used to play badminton but i don't anymore
i walked home in the rain without an umbrella
i want this contract translated word for word
i want to give him a present for his birthday
i want to know when tom began studying french
i was able to find the book i was looking for
i was about to have dinner when she called me
i was hoping tom would help me load the truck
i was in australia for three weeks last month
i wasn't aware that you were feeling that bad
i will look after your cat while you are away
i will write letters to you as often as i can
i wish i could explain it better but i can't
i wish he had been more careful when he spoke
i wish that i were rich enough to buy a yacht
i wonder how long this cold weather will last
i wonder if tom is having as much fun as mary
i wonder if tom is still motivated to do that
i wonder what tom is going to do next weekend
